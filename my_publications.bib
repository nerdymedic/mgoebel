Each lead of the ECG had the following measurements recorded: baseline wander, QRS signal amplitude, and artifact amplitude. A lasso regression technique was used to create the model. RESULTS The area under the curve for the model using all 36 elements is 1.0, indicating a perfect fit. A simplified model using 22 terms has an area under the curve of 0.994.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND A significant increase in false positive ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) electrocardiogram interpretations was noted after replacement of all of the City of San Diego's 110 monitor-defibrillator units with a new brand. These concerns were brought to the manufacturer and a revised interpretive algorithm was implemented. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effects of a revised interpretation algorithm to identify STEMI when used by San Diego paramedics. METHODS Data were reviewed 6 months before and 6 months after the introduction of a revised interpretation algorithm. True-positive and false-positive interpretations were identified. Factors contributing to an incorrect interpretation were assessed and patient demographics were collected. RESULTS A total of 372 (234 preimplementation, 138 postimplementation) cases met inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in false positive STEMI (150 preimplementation, 40 postimplementation; p {\textless} 0.001) after implementation. The most common factors resulting in false positive before implementation were right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation. The new algorithm corrected for these misinterpretations with most postimplementation false positives attributed to benign early repolarization and poor data quality. Subsequent follow-up at 10 months showed maintenance of the observed reduction in false positives. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that introducing a revised 12-lead interpretive algorithm resulted in a significant reduction in the number of false positive STEMI electrocardiogram interpretations in a large urban emergency medical services system. Rigorous testing and standardization of new interpretative software is recommended before introduction into a clinical setting to prevent issues resulting from inappropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory activations.},

The aim of this study was to describe the technical structure of the 9-1-1 call-taking system and to describe its vulnerabilities that could lead to compromised patient care.
9-1-1 calls answered from mobile phones and landlines use a variety of technologies to provide information about caller location and other information. These interconnected technologies create potential cyber vulnerabilities. A variety of attacks could be carried out on 9-1-1 infrastructure to various ends. Attackers could target individuals, groups, or entire municipalities. These attacks could result in anything from a nuisance to increased loss of life in a physical attack to worse overall outcomes owing to delays in care for time-sensitive conditions. Evolving 9-1-1 systems are increasingly connected and dependent on network technology. As implications of cybersecurity vulnerabilities loom large, future research should examine methods of hardening the 9-1-1 system against attack. [J Med Internet Res 2019;21(7):e14383]},

	abstract = {Introduction: San Diego has one of the busiest international land border crossings in the world. The epidemiology of prehospital care at the San Diego (California, United States) - Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico) border crossings are previously unreported. Investigators sought to describe prehospital care provided at the San Diego border crossings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective data collection from April 2014 to March 2017 evaluating prehospital provider (PHP) contacts at two international border crossing addresses in San Diego. The 9-1-1 dispatch center and first response were provided by a single municipal fire agency with ambulance transportation provided by a contracting private agency. Patient dispatch data and electronic patient care records were queried for patient demographics, PHP arrival time, incident complaint, assessment narrative, and treatments provided. Natural language processing techniques were applied to map the narrative to the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System. Descriptive analysis was performed in the R software program. Results: A total of 6,261 PHP patient contacts were made at the two border crossings during the study period. 87\% of the calls were at the San Ysidro border crossing compared to 13\% at Otay Mesa. The population, composed of 50.8\% males, had ages ranging from 0 days - 103 years old, with a median age of 45 years old. There were 606 (9.7\%) pediatric patients ({\textless}18 years) and 1,416 (22.6\%) geriatric patients ({\textgreater}65 years). The top three incident complaints were respiratory distress (830, 10.8\%) blunt trauma (827, 10.7\%) and abdominal pain (814, 10.6\%), and the top 3 medications provided were oxygen (481, 7.7\%), normal saline (393, 6.3\%) and ondansetron (352, 5.6\%). Conclusion: This was the first study of PHP assessment and care at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossings. We found a large diversity in patient ages. Respiratory distress and blunt trauma were the most frequent complaints and oxygen was the most frequent treatment. The busiest day of the week was Sunday, and the busiest month of the year was July. Our newly described findings may assist EMS agencies with optimizing staff, equipment, and training at international border crossings.},

	abstract = {Introduction: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a time-sensitive entity that has been shown to benefit from prehospital diagnosis by electrocardiogram (ECG). Current computer algorithms with binary decision making are not accurate enough to be relied on for cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation. Hypothesis: An algorithmic approach is proposed to stratify binary STEMI computerized ECG interpretations into low, intermediate, and high STEMI probability tiers.
Methods: Based on previous literature, a four-criteria algorithm was developed to rule out/in common causes of prehospital STEMI false-positive computer interpretations: heart rate, QRS width, ST elevation criteria, and artifact. Prehospital STEMI cases were prospectively collected at a single academic center in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) from May 2012 through October 2013. The prehospital ECGs were applied to the algorithm and compared against activation of the CCL by an emergency department (ED) physician as the outcome of interest. In addition to calculating test characteristics, linear regression was used to look for an association between number of criteria used and accuracy, and logistic regression was used to test if any single criterion performed better than another.
Results: There were 63 ECGs available for review, 39 high probability and 24 intermediate probability. The high probability STEMI tier had excellent test characteristics for ruling in STEMI when all four criteria were used, specificity 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.59-1.00), positive predictive value 1.00 (0.91-1.00). Linear regression showed a strong correlation demonstrating that false-positives increased as fewer criteria were used (adjusted r-square 0.51; P {\textless}.01). Logistic regression showed no significant predictive value for any one criterion over another (P = .80). Limiting physician overread to the intermediate tier only would reduce the number of ECGs requiring physician overread by a factor of 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.75; P {\textless}.01).
Conclusion: Prehospital STEMI ECGs can be accurately stratified to high, intermediate, and low probabilities for STEMI using the four criteria. While additional study is required, using this tiered algorithmic approach in prehospital ECGs could lead to changes in CCL activation and decreased requirements for physician overread. This may have significant clinical and quality implications.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Prehospital acquisition of electrocardiograms (ECG) has been consistently associated with reduced door-to-balloon times in the treatment of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). There is little evidence establishing best hospital practices once the ECG has been received by the emergency department (ED). This study evaluates the use of a push notification system to reduce delays in cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation for prehospital STEMI.
Methods: In this prospective before-and-after study, we collected prehospital ECGs with computer interpretation of STEMI from May 2012 to October 2013. Push notifications were implemented June 1, 2013. During the study period, we collected timestamps of when the prehospital ECG was received (email timestamp of receiving account), CCL team activation (timestamp in paging system), and patient arrival (timestamp in ED tracking board). When prehospital ECGs were received in the ED, an audible alert was played via the Vocera WiFi communication system, notifying nursing staff that an ECG was available for physician interpretation. We compared the time from receiving the ECG to activation of the CCL before and after the audible notification was implemented.
Results: Of the 56 cases received, we included 45 in our analysis (20 cases with pre-arrival CCL activation and 25 with post-arrival activation). For the pre-arrival group, the interval from ECG received to CCL activation prior to implementation was 9.1 minutes with a standard deviation (SD) of 5.7 minutes. After implementation, the interval was reduced to 3.33 minutes with a SD of 1.63 minutes. Delay was decreased by 5.8 minutes (p {\textless} 0.01). Post-implementation activation times were more consistent, demonstrated by a decrease in SD from 5.75 to 1.63 min (p {\textless} 0.01). For patients with CCL activation after arrival, there was no significant change in mean delay after implementation.
Conclusion: In this small, single-center observational study, we demonstrated that the use of push notifications to ED staff alerting that a prehospital STEMI ECG was received correlated with a small reduction in, and increased consistency of, ED CCL activation.},
