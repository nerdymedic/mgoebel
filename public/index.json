Current computer algorithms with binary decision making are not accurate enough to be relied on for cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation. Hypothesis: An algorithmic approach is proposed to stratify binary STEMI computerized ECG interpretations into low, intermediate, and high STEMI probability tiers. Methods: Based on previous literature, a four-criteria algorithm was developed to rule out/in common causes of prehospital STEMI false-positive computer interpretations: heart rate, QRS width, ST elevation criteria, and artifact. Prehospital STEMI cases were prospectively collected at a single academic center in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) from May 2012 through October 2013. The prehospital ECGs were applied to the algorithm and compared against activation of the CCL by an emergency department (ED) physician as the outcome of interest. In addition to calculating test characteristics, linear regression was used to look for an association between number of criteria used and accuracy, and logistic regression was used to test if any single criterion performed better than another. Results: There were 63 ECGs available for review, 39 high probability and 24 intermediate probability. The high probability STEMI tier had excellent test characteristics for ruling in STEMI when all four criteria were used, specificity 1.00 (95% CI, 0.59-1.00), positive predictive value 1.00 (0.91-1.00). Linear regression showed a strong correlation demonstrating that false-positives increased as fewer criteria were used (adjusted r-square 0.51; P textless.01). Logistic regression showed no significant predictive value for any one criterion over another (P = .80). Limiting physician overread to the intermediate tier only would reduce the number of ECGs requiring physician overread by a factor of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.48-0.75; P textless.01). Conclusion: Prehospital STEMI ECGs can be accurately stratified to high, intermediate, and low probabilities for STEMI using the four criteria. While additional study is required, using this tiered algorithmic approach in prehospital ECGs could lead to changes in CCL activation and decreased requirements for physician overread. This may have significant clinical and quality implications.","tags":null,"title":"A Novel Algorithm for Improving the Diagnostic Accuracy of Prehospital ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566950400,"objectID":"c0ed93081e8b0578d2fb6d02a2e0f528","permalink":"/talk/event1/","publishdate":"2019-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/event1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"NSTEMIs that need the cath lab now, Part 1","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jennifer Farah","Mat Goebel","Jodie Pierce","J.

The epidemiology of prehospital care at the San Diego (California, United States) - Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico) border crossings are previously unreported. Investigators sought to describe prehospital care provided at the San Diego border crossings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective data collection from April 2014 to March 2017 evaluating prehospital provider (PHP) contacts at two international border crossing addresses in San Diego. The 9-1-1 dispatch center and first response were provided by a single municipal fire agency with ambulance transportation provided by a contracting private agency. Patient dispatch data and electronic patient care records were queried for patient demographics, PHP arrival time, incident complaint, assessment narrative, and treatments provided. Natural language processing techniques were applied to map the narrative to the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System. Descriptive analysis was performed in the R software program. Results: A total of 6,261 PHP patient contacts were made at the two border crossings during the study period. 87% of the calls were at the San Ysidro border crossing compared to 13% at Otay Mesa. The population, composed of 50.8% males, had ages ranging from 0 days - 103 years old, with a median age of 45 years old. There were 606 (9.7%) pediatric patients (textless18 years) and 1,416 (22.6%) geriatric patients (textgreater65 years). The top three incident complaints were respiratory distress (830, 10.8%) blunt trauma (827, 10.7%) and abdominal pain (814, 10.6%), and the top 3 medications provided were oxygen (481, 7.7%), normal saline (393, 6.3%) and ondansetron (352, 5.6%). Conclusion: This was the first study of PHP assessment and care at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossings. We found a large diversity in patient ages. Respiratory distress and blunt trauma were the most frequent complaints and oxygen was the most frequent treatment. The busiest day of the week was Sunday, and the busiest month of the year was July. Our newly described findings may assist EMS agencies with optimizing staff, equipment, and training at international border crossings.","tags":["border crossing","Emergency Medical Services (EMS)","mass gathering","prehospital epidemiology","U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)"],"title":"Epidemiology of Prehospital Care at the San Diego (USA) - Tijuana (Mexico) International Border Crossing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Farah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"af9617b4247d3ec906e552c42bed65ad","permalink":"/publication/farah-jennifer-epidemiology-2019-1/","publishdate":"2019-11-10T18:33:33.219526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/farah-jennifer-epidemiology-2019-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Epidemiology of 911 Calls at the San Diego Border Crossing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mat Goebel","Joseph Bledsoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"b8a2ddd6b011c2afb26432900ca55344","permalink":"/publication/goebel-push-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-10T18:33:33.216096Z","relpermalink":"/publication/goebel-push-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Prehospital acquisition of electrocardiograms (ECG) has been consistently associated with reduced door-to-balloon times in the treatment of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). There is little evidence establishing best hospital practices once the ECG has been received by the emergency department (ED). This study evaluates the use of a push notification system to reduce delays in cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation for prehospital STEMI. Methods: In this prospective before-and-after study, we collected prehospital ECGs with computer interpretation of STEMI from May 2012 to October 2013. Push notifications were implemented June 1, 2013. During the study period, we collected timestamps of when the prehospital ECG was received (email timestamp of receiving account), CCL team activation (timestamp in paging system), and patient arrival (timestamp in ED tracking board). When prehospital ECGs were received in the ED, an audible alert was played via the Vocera WiFi communication system, notifying nursing staff that an ECG was available for physician interpretation. We compared the time from receiving the ECG to activation of the CCL before and after the audible notification was implemented. Results: Of the 56 cases received, we included 45 in our analysis (20 cases with pre-arrival CCL activation and 25 with post-arrival activation). For the pre-arrival group, the interval from ECG received to CCL activation prior to implementation was 9.1 minutes with a standard deviation (SD) of 5.7 minutes. After implementation, the interval was reduced to 3.33 minutes with a SD of 1.63 minutes. Delay was decreased by 5.8 minutes (p textless 0.01). Post-implementation activation times were more consistent, demonstrated by a decrease in SD from 5.75 to 1.63 min (p textless 0.01). For patients with CCL activation after arrival, there was no significant change in mean delay after implementation. Conclusion: In this small, single-center observational study, we demonstrated that the use of push notifications to ED staff alerting that a prehospital STEMI ECG was received correlated with a small reduction in, and increased consistency of, ED CCL activation.","tags":null,"title":"Push Notifications Reduce Emergency Department Response Times to Prehospital ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

These interconnected technologies create potential cyber vulnerabilities. A variety of attacks could be carried out on 9-1-1 infrastructure to various ends. Attackers could target individuals, groups, or entire municipalities. These attacks could result in anything from a nuisance to increased loss of life in a physical attack to worse overall outcomes owing to delays in care for time-sensitive conditions. Evolving 9-1-1 systems are increasingly connected and dependent on network technology. As implications of cybersecurity vulnerabilities loom large, future research should examine methods of hardening the 9-1-1 system against attack.

Each lead of the ECG had the following measurements recorded: baseline wander, QRS signal amplitude, and artifact amplitude. A lasso regression technique was used to create the model. RESULTS The area under the curve for the model using all 36 elements is 1.0, indicating a perfect fit. A simplified model using 22 terms has an area under the curve of 0.994.

These concerns were brought to the manufacturer and a revised interpretive algorithm was implemented. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effects of a revised interpretation algorithm to identify STEMI when used by San Diego paramedics. METHODS Data were reviewed 6 months before and 6 months after the introduction of a revised interpretation algorithm. True-positive and false-positive interpretations were identified. Factors contributing to an incorrect interpretation were assessed and patient demographics were collected. RESULTS A total of 372 (234 preimplementation, 138 postimplementation) cases met inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in false positive STEMI (150 preimplementation, 40 postimplementation; p textless 0.001) after implementation. The most common factors resulting in false positive before implementation were right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation. The new algorithm corrected for these misinterpretations with most postimplementation false positives attributed to benign early repolarization and poor data quality. Subsequent follow-up at 10 months showed maintenance of the observed reduction in false positives. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that introducing a revised 12-lead interpretive algorithm resulted in a significant reduction in the number of false positive STEMI electrocardiogram interpretations in a large urban emergency medical services system. Rigorous testing and standardization of new interpretative software is recommended before introduction into a clinical setting to prevent issues resulting from inappropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory activations.","tags":null,"title":"Prehospital Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Identification in San Diego: A Retrospective Analysis of the Effect of a New Software Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Uncategorized"],"content":"I\u0026#8217;ve been active in UCSD SOM\u0026#8217;s Emergency Medicine Interest Group\u0026#8217;s leadership since I was an MS1. For the 2017-18 year I\u0026#8217;ve been acting as the president \u0026#8211; coordinating all the mentoring, events, and communication.\nLike us on facebook!\n","date":1515020157,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515020157,"objectID":"8f92a364f2f9cda73fb8ae9b69ae91ae","permalink":"/p398/","publishdate":"2018-01-03T22:55:57Z","relpermalink":"/p398/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026#8217;ve been active in UCSD SOM\u0026#8217;s Emergency Medicine Interest Group\u0026#8217;s leadership since I was an MS1. For the 2017-18 year I\u0026#8217;ve been acting as the president \u0026#8211; coordinating all the mentoring, events, and communication.\nLike us on facebook!","tags":null,"title":"UCSD EMIG","type":"post"},{"authors":["Christopher R.

I\u0026#8217;m comfortable with cadavers. Really, they don\u0026#8217;t bother me.\nBut this week working in the ED I had an experience that unexpectedly shook me.\nIt was a fairly busy night like any other; I was working as the EKG tech \u0026#8211; running from room to room getting 12-Leads on the usual mix of chest paineurs and overdoses. With a break in the incessant buzz of my pager, I sat down at my computer behind the nurse\u0026#8217;s station to enter orders and do assorted paperwork. I barely noticed the Vocera announcement that a trauma one was coming in. I\u0026#8217;m not a regular ED tech, and I\u0026#8217;m not signed off to work on a trauma team, so it\u0026#8217;s only something I notice in passing.\nMy computer is next to the telemetry screens so that when I\u0026#8217;m doing paperwork I can monitor what\u0026#8217;s going on in the ED. Halfway through entering an ordering a red flash and a chime caught my eye \u0026#8212; *\\*VTAC**. It was in a trauma bay.\nIn that moment I became aware of the huddle of nurses and techs behind me. Apparently the trauma one had become a traumatic code en route to us. Not good. We watched holding our breath as the rhythms bounced through various iterations of ACLS badness. My pager went off and I was torn away to do more 12-Leads.\nI passed the trauma bay a few minutes later in the course of my normal duties. CPR was in progress. I casually noted that the compressions were probably a bit faster than the AHA guidelines of 100 per minute and wondered if there was any data to suggest that there were better or worse outcomes for faster compressions. I didn\u0026#8217;t think much about the code; I was a good three pages behind.\nLater I sat down at my work station to do more paperwork. I looked at the trauma bay on telemetry: *\\*LEADS DISCONNECTED**\nThat\u0026#8217;s either really good or really bad. Statistically I knew what do expect.\nAt that moment I overheard one of the nurses mention that they had called it just a few minutes before and were preparing the body for viewing by the family. My heart sunk.\nEven though I knew that she was basically dead before she hit the ED doors, even though I wasn\u0026#8217;t on the trauma team that worked to save her, I felt culpable. It felt so wrong, knowing someone\u0026#8217;s daughter had died before her parents did. I honestly felt a little sick.\nThe familiar nagging of my pager brought me back into focus. Off to do another 12-Lead\u0026#8230;\nIt wasn\u0026#8217;t long before I needed to cross the hallway by the trauma bay again. As I approached it somehow seemed longer..emptier\u0026#8230; lonelier than I remembered. As I got closer I recognised one our social workers standing outside with her back to the bay and her head hung low. I could make out muffled whimpers and cries from the inside. My heart sank again. I took a detour through the imaging department to avoid walking past. It seemed like the right thing to do\u0026#8230;this was a very private moment for someone else. I went about my business for the remainder of the shift, avoiding the trauma bay like a crack in the sidewalk or the path of a black cat.\nToward the end of the shift I had some chores to do \u0026#8211; namely refilling the blanket and fluid warmers. This includes the trauma bays. I did every other part of the ED first. Then I did all the other trauma bays, hoping that I would run out of clean blankets before I got to where she was so I wouldn\u0026#8217;t have to see her\u0026#8230;no, so I wouldn\u0026#8217;t have to disturb her. I swore in my head a little when I still had blankets as my cart squeaked up to the threshold outside her room. I carefully and quietly peered in to make sure no family were present. It had been hours, but who knows.\nShe was on the table, laying there peacefully with her arms unnaturally still at her sides. The ET tube was still in place. Her face and hands were ashen. The room was dark except for a single light above the table that illuminated her white draped form. Two empty chairs from the lobby flanked the table. I quietly slid in to refill the blanket and fluid warmers. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. My heart was racing. My mind was going even faster, calculating all the reasons that this shouldn\u0026#8217;t be happening. Every ounce of my being cried out \u0026#8220;this thing should not be.\u0026#8221; I realised that what I\u0026#8217;d felt earlier was not sickness, but sadness.\nI apologised for disturbing her, and not just in my head. You might think it\u0026#8217;s weird, but if you\u0026#8217;ve spent any significant amount of time working in a cadaver lab, you\u0026#8217;ve likely started talking to them. It\u0026#8217;s probably more to put me at ease, but I like to think they can hear me. Well not the physical-them that I\u0026#8217;m working with, but the spirit-them that\u0026#8217;s now out there somewhere.\nI finished my task and took one long last look at her before my pager went off again. Someone had ordered another EKG on the panic attack.\nThis experience genuinely spooked me. When I got home I needed my fiance to come over just so I could hold her tight and tell her I loved her. I needed to know she was okay. It took every ounce of self control not to call her and make sure she was okay the second I\u0026#8217;d head that the code was called.\nBut, why did it bother me so much in the first place? Like I said I\u0026#8217;ve spent hundreds of hours with dozens of different cadavers. What made this so different? I\u0026#8217;ve narrowed it down to a few things.\n1 \u0026#8211; She was young. Younger than me. And that\u0026#8217;s just against the natural order of things.\n2 \u0026#8211; While most don\u0026#8217;t choose death, at least cadavers in a lab have chosen to be there. A certain serenity comes from knowing that everyone is there because they want to be. That wasn\u0026#8217;t the case here.\n3 \u0026#8211; I\u0026#8217;m used to working on a cadaver, and then learning about who they were as a person by reverse engineering their medical history and listening to family members at memorial services. To me, cadavers become people. I\u0026#8217;ve never had to mentally transition the other way from person to cadaver.\nI hope in some small way that writing this out will be therapeutic and help me organise my feelings. I know this is just the first of many of these experiences that I\u0026#8217;ll have in emergency medicine. It has to be a valuable lesson \u0026#8211; of what I\u0026#8217;m not sure yet.\nI just hope that when I close my eyes to go to sleep tonight, that I can stop seeing her face.\n ","date":1286048280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1286048280,"objectID":"ea87c862397e5040cd535652236ed3e6","permalink":"/p158/","publishdate":"2010-10-02T19:38:00Z","relpermalink":"/p158/","section":"post","summary":"I have spent literally hundred of hours with cadavers \u0026#8211; either as a students in the anatomy lab or dissecting them for those students.

I see their scars, their disease ravaged organs. I find every deformity, variation, and imperfection in their bodies. I find surgeries that suggest medical history: apendectomies, coronary bypass, hysterectomies. I find tumours. I can\u0026#8217;t help but wonder: What pain were they in? How was their disease managed? How did this happen? How long were they tormented by this? Were they glad when it was over? Sad to be gone? This person is someones son or daughter. How did their family handle everything that happened?\nI know this donor very intimately in a physical (and I feel also spiritual) way, but I still know nothing about them aside from a reverse engineered medical history. I don\u0026#8217;t know who they are. I don\u0026#8217;t know what this brain thought, what these eyes saw, or what these hands did. I can\u0026#8217;t help but wonder \u0026#8211; I know the tremendous educational work this person is performing in death, but what did they do in life?\nAfter both the dean of the school of medicine and the head of the emergency medicine residency programme had spoken and shared experiences about the value of having body donors, it was open mic for the donor families.\nFamily members shared stories that answered the burning questions I had. These strangers I\u0026#8217;ve been bonding with at the dissection table were civil rights activists, esteemed professors, physicians, nurses, lawyers, veterans of wars, and other just plain good people who wanted to do some good after their body is no longer of use to them.\nMany of the donor families don\u0026#8217;t know exactly what we\u0026#8217;re doing, but through the various speakers during the service and side conversations at the reception that followed, I hope they learned one thing: When we walk out of that room that contains their loved ones, that we are better for it. We\u0026#8217;re smarter, more skilled, more experienced clinicians. As someone who learned anatomy with a human cadaver lab, I cannot imagine the course without it. I remember one day looking at a textbook illustration, then at a photo, then at a model, and understaning how these various representations worked together to communicate an idea. Then I went to the cadaver and had to relearn it because these were abstractions of the reality on the table.\nEvery one of us is special and unique. I believe I first learned that lesson in grade one. However, without the generous gifts of body donors, and the incredible sarcifice of their families, medical students (paramedics, physicians, nurses, etc) would not have the ability to really see and feel how different we each are \u0026#8211; and more importantly how those differences can affect the care we will later provide.\nSo today I say this \u0026#8211; thank you body donors. Thank you for you generous gift. Thanks to your families for their sacrifice. They\u0026#8217;re giving you up for two years. They\u0026#8217;re putting off receiving closure for my benefit. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nTo the familes, your loved one\u0026#8217;s time is well spent. I love them and care for them knowing they are someone\u0026#8217;s son or daughter, husband or wife, father or mother, sister or brother. They give me a tour of the marvelous human body. I get the chance to see and make connections between things that other people will only ever see in artist\u0026#8217;s renditions. I get to connect the dots when I interact with a patient \u0026#8211; I know what\u0026#8217;s really going on under the hood, and it makes all the difference.\nKnow that for as much as your loved one has affected me in the last two semesters I\u0026#8217;ve had the privilidge of working with them, that the experience they\u0026#8217;ve given me will touch the lives of every patient I encouter for my entire career.\nThe military medevac motto is \u0026#8220;so that others may live.\u0026#8221; Your loved ones have died by some means \u0026#8211; perhaps tragic and unpreventable such as a disease that currently cannot be cured. Through this donation, their death has new meaning. While they may not cure the thing they died from, they are arming me to save lives for the rest of my career. Your family member died, and now others may live.\nBody donors, I salute and thank you. To the donor families, thank you also. Please sleep well at night knowing the difference you and your family are making in my life and the lives of those who I will care for in the future. Please know that I love and respect your family members. To me they are people, and I want nothing more than to know them better. Thank you for sharing them with me.

My first stop after landing was a bonfire on the beach. While getting the fire going and cooking some hot dogs, I noticed a regular pattern of Lifeguard vehicles driving back and forth. Meh.\nA while later I notice a change. One of these all-wheel-drive eco-friendly SUV\u0026#8217;s is clipping across the beach on a different path at a much faster pace. Maybe something is up\u0026#8230; but he\u0026#8217;s not running code 3, so maybe he\u0026#8217;s just in a hurry to get somewhere. A few minutes later another unit comes screaming down the beach, this time lights and sirens blaring. I know each vehicle has only one guard in it, and I\u0026#8217;m presuming that they don\u0026#8217;t have much additional medical training. I mosey over a couple hundred feet to the incident to poke my head in to see if the situation warrants offering assistance. Their patient is seated in the sand, sitting up on his own, answering questions. One guard is taking a blood pressure, the other asking questions. I have already made my \u0026#8220;from the door\u0026#8221; assessment of not sick/not hurt.\nI\u0026#8217;ve had multiple incidents where Lifeguards have identified themselves on a scene to insist they help, or they passed judgment on my ability to provide care (\u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re not from the fire department? When are the *real* EMT\u0026#8217;s getting here?\u0026#8221;). I had to resist every urge to reverse the tables for once and say \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m an EMT, I can help!\u0026#8221;\nAnyway, I digress. Fast forward 45 minutes.\nYes 45 minutes later they are still on-scene. In the distance I hear the dulcet tones of the federal Q2. An engine?\u0026#8230; And a rescue? Are they coming\u0026#8230;here? No\u0026#8230;really\u0026#8230;now?\nWhy yes\u0026#8230;45 minutes later ALS backup was called for. I also see a Coast Guard helicopter in the distance, closing in rapidly along the shore-line. Was my assessment that far off the mark? The helicopter banks over the incident and continues along the beach \u0026#8211; apparently just a coincidence. Fire Medics were on-scene for 5 minutes and then left.\nIt\u0026#8217;s understandable, being with a patient where something just doesn\u0026#8217;t feel right, you watch them and wait for them to either get worse or get better, eventually establishing whether you will release or transport. We\u0026#8217;ve all done it \u0026#8211; or at least I have. 45 minutes is a while to wait for such a decision, but I\u0026#8217;ll go along with it. Having had an ALS evaluation, I imagine our punter will be on his way any moment now.\nFast forward 60 minutes.\nYes, now the lifeguards have been on-scene for almost 2 hours. I hear multiple sirens in the distance converging from different directions. Two stations are now responding. I meander over again just because I want to hear the exchange between the Lifeguard and the Medics. Our patient is now laying in the sand covered in a blanket. The medic walks over and simply declares \u0026#8220;I don\u0026#8217;t care, this time we\u0026#8217;re taking him! Get him on the backboard!\u0026#8221;\nI know hindsight is 20\u0026frasl;20 and I wasn\u0026#8217;t actually on-scene evaluating the patient \u0026#8211; but as a trained observer it seemed like this call was full of all sorts of fail.\nLifeguards provide absolutely life savings extrication and rescue manoeuvres. They can perform BLS care early in an incident when it has the best chance of savings someone\u0026#8217;s life. But\u0026#8230;that\u0026#8217;s about all they do. Lifeguards are not God\u0026#8217;s gift to emergency response. More than once I\u0026#8217;ve been on a scene and had someone bound up to declare \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m a Lifeguard, I can help\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ll take it from here guys.\u0026#8221; I actually had one guy try to muscle in between me and a patient. A quick glare and he was put in his place by the officer on scene.\nThe second time a Lifeguard did this to me on scene a cop said \u0026#8220;Well does it looks like he\u0026#8217;s drowning?

It\u0026#8217;s about _thinking_ and implementing _appropriate_ interventions based on those findings.\nAnd where does the chip on your shoulder come from, ALS providers? So what if your patch is different form mine? Get over yourself \u0026#8211; the things you do that _really_ make a difference, I can do too \u0026#8211; even operating as a (gasp) BASIC! Heck, the stuff that makes the biggest difference (chest compression) can (and should) be done by a bystander before either of us even gets there. Paramedics don\u0026#8217;t save cardiac arrest patients \u0026#8211; bystanders who know CPR and AED do.\nWe need a unified identity as EMS providers. No matter your rank or speciality in the fire service, you identify with being a \u0026#8220;firefighter.\u0026#8221; No matter your rank or speciality in local law enforcement, you identify with being a \u0026#8220;police officer.\u0026#8221; No matter what your sub-specialty is, you all Doctors and Nurses identify with \u0026#8220;I am a Doctor/Nurse.\u0026#8221; People do not know the differences between EMT, Paramedic, and EMS. It\u0026#8217;s a great education opportunity to sit down and explain it someone, but shouldn\u0026#8217;t they understand it to begin with? Shouldn\u0026#8217;t my time be better spent talking about how to do hands-only CPR or why the flu is not an emergency? We need a unified identity. Maybe the best approach to this is to see what these words mean to the public already. Ideas define words, not the other way around. Language is ultimately arbitrary. What matters is that the ideas are agreed upon. Go ahead, call everyone a Paramedic. I know people who are \u0026#8220;just Basics\u0026#8221; that put more thought into their assessment than some Paramedics. Not all paramedics are trained/think/act/perform equally, so why be so exclusive with the title? Stop identifying yourself by what you can do, and start identifying with what you know.\nIn my major we spend a lot of time talking about language. Language changes thinking and thinking changes language. Let me give you a brief example. Before recorded music there was not live music, there was just music. Live music didn\u0026#8217;t exist because that was differentiation within. I think our EMS identity crisis is at least somewhat similar. While there are differences, the language to express them is confusing and essentially foreign to people outside of our field. If we can\u0026#8217;t to communicate with them, it\u0026#8217;s unreasonable to expect them to learn out language. We need to adapt our language to their understanding. If the language is plain enough and chosen carefully, we change how they perceive us.\nThere has been a lot of discussion lately about EMS education \u0026#8211; comparing us to MDs and RNs. I whole heartedly agree with those rants comments. I\u0026#8217;d like to study the history of nursing to see how it is that they eventually got to be taken seriously, and figure out what we\u0026#8217;re doing wrong as an industry. Maybe our whole education system needs to be rethought. I wouldn\u0026#8217;t mind doing a paramedic residency \u0026#8211; heck that would be awesome.\nI know that when I eventually get my Paramedic patch and card that my education is not complete, but just starting. I know there will probably be deficits in my education, but you better believe that I\u0026#8217;m going to do everything I can to fill in those gaps.\nOh\u0026#8230;and watching \u0026#8220;War Games\u0026#8221; recently\u0026#8230;I want to close by saying never just trust the machine.

I share with those who may stumble across this, my intimate knowledge of napping.\nNapping is awesome for increasing your alertness, productivity, and cognitive function. It combats sleepiness, which can be hazardous when providing patient care or operating a vehicle. If you\u0026#8217;re a student, it can also be hazardous to your grades.\n1 \u0026#8211; Introduction\nThe most important aspect of a nap is the duration. Secondarily, there are a some adjuncts you can use to increase the quality of your sleep.\nPhoto credit  The figure above is your sleep cycle. You can see that you go from being awake, to deep sleep, back to nearly waking, over and over until you awake (ideally) from a \u0026#8220;shallow\u0026#8221; REM sleep.\nEver wake up and just can\u0026#8217;t seem to get moving? That\u0026#8217;s called sleep inertia, and it\u0026#8217;s normally caused by a disagreement with your sleep cycle. You most likely woke up in deep instead of shallower sleep, so your body wasn\u0026#8217;t ready to wake up. If you had slept a little less or a little more, you would have been fine.\nIt\u0026#8217;s not very clear from the graphic above, but an average person\u0026#8217;s sleep cycle is around 90 minutes. Meaning, you go from waking, to deep sleep, nearly back to waking in an hour and a half. After you go to sleep, you really start to plummet into deep sleep after 20-30 minutes, and you won\u0026#8217;t be near waking again until the end of the 90 minute cycle.\n2 \u0026#8211; Duration\nUnderstanding your sleep cycle is the key to getting an energising nap. Since we want to wake up from a shallow sleep in order to avoid sleep inertia, our naps need to less than 30 minutes or at least 90. You may need to tweak these times based on how your personal sleep cycle exactly works. If you\u0026#8217;ve spent any time studying anatomy or physiology, you know that everybody is a little different. I can\u0026#8217;t stress enough that this is the biggest part of getting naps right \u0026#8211; the duration.\n3 \u0026#8211; Adjuncts\nSometimes we can use adjuncts to increase the quality of our nap and help us get to sleep faster.\nA. Sleep Mask\nPhoto Credit    You will never realise how much ambient light kept you from getting to sleep until you try using a sleep mask. Since you, as a medical professional, will likely be seeking napping bliss at all hours, these can he a huge help. Sleep masks have some different qualities or features you should be aware of when purchasing. Expect to spend around $20 for a decent one.  Material \u0026#8211; Masks come in nylon and cotton. Many people prefer the cotton or cloth-like materials. Consider going to a store and feeling a couple to decide what you prefer.  Light Blocking \u0026#8211; You would think that all sleep masks are 100% like blocking, but they aren\u0026#8217;t. Cheap nylon ones allow some light through and will annoy you. Most quality sleep masks that you will find for purchase will block all light. It\u0026#8217;s normally the cheap complimentary ones you get that will leak.  Padding \u0026#8211; Nicer sleep masks will feature padding in the periorbital region to keep the mask from laying completely against your eyes, as this can be annoying.  Ear plug storage \u0026#8211; if you choose to use earplugs, it can be convenient to store them in your sleep mask.  B. Ear Plugs  \n  This might sound familiar, but you won\u0026#8217;t realise how much ambient noise was distracting you from sleep until you use earplugs. There are a couple things to consider when purchasing earplugs. You should only need to spend, at most, a couple dollars on a pair of earplugs.  Noise Reduction Rating \u0026#8211; All earplugs are given a noise reduction rating in dBNR (decibels of noise reduction) that is the number of decibels the earplugs reduce ambient sound when worn correctly. The decibel scale is logarithmic and was modelled after the sensitivity of human hearing. Every 10 dB is factor of two (twice/half as loud), so earplugs with a 20dBNR rating would only allow 1/4 of the ambient sound into your ears.  Material/Construction \u0026#8211; Most of the earplugs you\u0026#8217;ve ever seen are probably the foam kind you\u0026#8217;re meant to squish and roll up to place in the external auditory meatus. These can be very comfortable, but are easily worn incorrectly. When it comes to disposable earplugs, I prefer the triple flanged rubber type pictured above.  If you\u0026#8217;re serious about earplugs for occupational reasons (or whatever), you can see an audiologist and order custom fitted earplugs. I\u0026#8217;ve had great success with EAR Inc. If you go the custom route, you can easily spend $100 or more for fitted \u0026#8220;musician\u0026#8221; earplugs. However, you\u0026#8217;ll only want simple solid silicone molds for napping. These will cost considerably less, probably only $40 total, but I\u0026#8217;m not completely sure as I\u0026#8217;ve only ever ordered the musician type.  C. Caffeine  \n  You might be thinking, \u0026#8220;how on earth can caffeine helper rather than hinder a nap?\u0026#8221; We all know that after it\u0026#8217;s ingested, caffeine will take some time to actually be absorbed and have any effect. Luckily this happens to be around the same length of time our short nap will be. So, if you quickly drink some caffeine, then take a 20-30 minute nap, when coming out of it you will have the combined benefits of the sleep and the caffeine. Caffeinated power naps are awesome.  4 \u0026#8211; Conclusion / Summary  \n  Naps are amazing. Use them. Sleep less than 30 minutes. If you need to sleep more, then go for at least 90. Use a sleep mask and earplugs to improve how quickly you fall asleep. Pound some caffeine right before a 20-30 minute nap for an extra pick me up.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

Just no. The patient reports that he is now feeling dizzy. I get a fresh set of vitals to fins his heart rate is elevated for someone who has been sitting on the couch. Really? Hypovolaemia from a paper cut? Really? It\u0026#8217;s _just_ a papercut? Is this seriously happening?\nFine. Let\u0026#8217;s go to the hospital We hop into the gutless wonder our vehicle and tear off to St Closets as fast as we can \u0026#8211; meaning a snail could easily outpace us. On our way to the hospital I call ahead and ask if they would like me to drop our patient off in the waiting room or go through the ambulance door. I\u0026#8217;m told it\u0026#8217;s slow, so to come on through the ambulance doors.\nThe sliding doors open and the charge nurse glances at the three of us walking into the ED, realising that our patient is indeed holding a 4\u0026#215;4 over their thumb. She gives me a stern look over her glasses. Without saying a word, she speaks volumes. _Are you seriously bringing \u0026#8220;I hurted my finger\u0026#8221; to my level 2 trauma centre?_ Her criticism resonates in my skulls like she\u0026#8217;s communicated telepathically. Unfortunately, tin foil hats are not part of our standard PPE, so I have no protection from her silent criticism as I walk my patient to the indicated room.\nSt Closets is the only hospital in my city, so it could also be called St Onlys. This was also before the hospital opened an urgent care clinic, so the ED is the only medical attention you can get outside of business hours. Yes Nurse Ratched, I am bringing you my patient with her boo-boo. And I\u0026#8217;m doing it proudly, as we at the band-aid brigade rarely get to transport patients. So if you please, kiss it and make it better, and we\u0026#8217;ll be out of your hair before the Fire Department can bring you the town drunk for the evening.\nI give my handoff to an equally sceptical nurse at the bedside. She sees that our patient has now bled through the 4\u0026#215;4 I applied earlier. A tech puts on a fresh one and matter-of-factly adds a pressure dressing. \u0026#8220;There\u0026#8221; he seems to say as he walks out of the room.\nI poke my head in 20 minutes later. The pressure dressing has bled through. Told ya so.\nA physician , nurse, and tech enter the room with a shared look of consternation/frustration/irritation/annoyance/awe/disbelief. It\u0026#8217;s decided to stitch it shut. Yes, what amounts to a paper cut is about to be stitched.\nTwo stitches later the bleeding is finally controlled. The \u0026#8220;injury\u0026#8221; is then covered in fresh pressure dressing and splinted to prevent any movement from tearing the stitches. With all this wound care, our patient\u0026#8217;s thumb is now at least five times its normal size. His face seems to say, \u0026#8220;FML.\u0026#8221;\nI chuckle keep a straight face and very professionally call us back in service.\n ","date":1261969320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1261969320,"objectID":"ff47b4c83cc1c0cfa2884e6c7cdf59f5","permalink":"/p93/","publishdate":"2009-12-28T03:02:00Z","relpermalink":"/p93/","section":"post","summary":"Tones drop for a male with a bleeding disorder that cut his finger.\nBand-aid brigade to the rescue!\nWe arrive to find our patient loosely holding a paper towel over the injury.

Sometimes, though, events call for celebration.\nLast year I decided to really start pursuing emergency medicine as a career over technical theatre. As such, I took Human Anatomy this semester. I sat in on the lectures for a semester before I took it to see what I was getting into. I was afraid. Very afraid.\nThe hardest part of the course that people talk about is the lab. Hundreds and hundreds of new terms. Find them on this cadaver, in that specimen, on this model, in this illustration. What it\u0026#8217;s structural classification? Functional? What kind of epithelial tissue is it? What hormones does it secrete? What\u0026#8217;s it\u0026#8217;s origin? Insertion?\nHead asplode.\nI bought the lab manual and spent all summer learning just the bones. That was two weeks of material? It took me three months to get comfortable with this. I could lose my scholarship. FML.\nThen came the first day in lab. I kept up with my TA for about the first 30 minutes of the 2 hour lab. After that my head was full. Why are you still talking to me? Words come out of your mouth, TA, but it sounds like you\u0026#8217;re speaking in tongues. Did I just have a stroke?\nSo I went to open lab \u0026#8211; free study time with TAs to get all the information you missed in your proper lab section \u0026#8211; meaning probably most of it. 6 hours a week. By the time my weekly quiz rolled around I found myself standing next to the TA teaching other students.\nSo the quizzes went well. \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s to be expected,\u0026#8221; I thought. We were still reviewing the material I had self-taught over the summer. D-day would be week 3: upper body muscles. But that came and went. The nice thing about sciences is that you can always put more time in. It\u0026#8217;s got nothing to do with your feelings (cough theatre cough); it\u0026#8217;s either right or wrong.\nBy the midterm I could count on one hand the number of pins I had missed. It was a good feeling, and a lot of people disliked me for it. But they didn\u0026#8217;t spend 6 hours a week studying in open lab. They complained about how cold the specimens were. They complained about the smells. They complained about the relentless onslaught of new terms. What they didn\u0026#8217;t do was study.\nAnd then there were the lectures. 2 hours per week with it\u0026#8217;s own separate language, and it has everything to do with the lab because\u0026#8230; They\u0026#8217;re both about humans? That\u0026#8217;s about where the overlap ended. 3 more hours per week of review sessions. At least the TA was cute.\nBetween lecture and lab I spent an average of 12 hours per week either in class or in reviews/open lab.\nLecture midterm 1: 94%\nLecture midterm 2: 95%\nLecture Final: 91%\nLab midterm: 98%\nLab Final: 99%\nOverall grade 96%.\nA solid A in a class I was scared to death of.

You might be able to tell from the tone of my post, but I think the EMS community was largely ignorant in so quickly judging the show. If you only watched the pilot, said that it \u0026#8220;sucked\u0026#8221; and never tuned in again, you\u0026#8217;re a fool and I hope you put more effort into other parts of your life.\n \u0026#8212;\nIt had a rough start, but I liked the direction it was heading. I found myself cringing less and less.\nI seem to have a different perspective on the show than most of my friends and co-workers You see. they\u0026#8217;re all bio and exercise science majors who are EMTs hoping to get into Med School or Nursing school, and I am a Theatre major who discovered EMS too late in a college career to change majors, and will be headed to Paramedic school after I finish my undergrad this year to pursue what I\u0026#8217;ve found that I truly love. My entire college career has focused on critiquing performance and media; so let me share a few unorganised thoughts.\nI like Trauma.\nI was starting to see parts of my different partners in each of the characters. They also saw me in some of the characters.\nThe humour was getting better. A lot better. I remember the first time I thought they nailed \u0026#8220;on-scene humour\u0026#8221;, that the show might succeed or that as a community we might warm up to it.\nI think most EMS types were critical of it because it was different from what they were expecting. Just because it\u0026#8217;s not what you wanted doesn\u0026#8217;t make it \u0026#8220;bad.\u0026#8221; We readily recognise that foreign films may be good, just not our bag of crisps. Why can\u0026#8217;t we be so accepting of TV? Because it\u0026#8217;s not \u0026#8220;high art\u0026#8221; like film? The intent of the series was to entertain. A *byproduct* of that is to create awareness and raise questions. Most of us wanted a documentary. But guess what? The public doesn\u0026#8217;t want a documentary \u0026#8211; that\u0026#8217;s already been done in the late 90s on TLC (and yes I still watch those re-runs). Docs have been done \u0026#8211; and they\u0026#8217;re good but they\u0026#8217;re short running and don\u0026#8217;t make much money.\nThe show does, however, have elements of a Doc. It\u0026#8217;s putting focus on a marginalised group. Luckily it wasn\u0026#8217;t shot like a doc or a news reel. People might have thought this actually 100% real to what we do. But guess what? TV viewers suspend their disbelief because they know it\u0026#8217;s a TV show. I doubt most people will be watching us code a family member, demanding to know why we aren\u0026#8217;t shocking the patient in asystole. Their memory of the events probably will resemble the way it\u0026#8217;s portrayed on Trauma.\nWe all complain that EMS is under-recognised and does not have a unified voice for change. Where do you expect that recognition to come from? Trauma generally put us in a good light \u0026#8211; shocking asystole and HEMS abuse aside. That raises awareness and creates the *opportunity* for dialogue. I think cancelling the show has closed a door for the EMS community. People could have started asking a lot of questions about us \u0026#8211; questions we could have answered. Instead of actualyl educating we said \u0026#8220;that\u0026#8217;s a dumb question.\u0026#8221; There\u0026#8217;s no faster way to turn off a student to a subject than communicating that. We were quick to judge, and rather than reach out a hand to lift up, we wished it to fail.\nI completely agree with the first comment here. Where do you think the writers and producers got these notions? Who else do we have to blame for misconceptions about our industry? If we want to create a positive imagine and change things for the better (EMS 2.0?) then we need to support exposure opportunities like Trauma.\nWorking for a volunteer EMS agency, I\u0026#8217;m acutely aware that things aren\u0026#8217;t always that action packed. And my maybe my \u0026#8220;young pup\u0026#8221; nature gets me excited for these intense traumas, MCIs, and other insanity on a weekly basis. Maybe the older guys are jaded enough to just think that it\u0026#8217;s stupid. I\u0026#8217;m with HM though \u0026#8211; somewhere someone watched this and decided to take that EMT-B class at their community college. Someone remembered that \u0026#8220;cool calls\u0026#8221; happen once in a while. Someone remembered when the Paramedics came and helped their [family member] with their [nature of illness or mechanism of injury] and how brave and skilled they were. And you know what? They probably remember is being just as intense as Trauma shows it \u0026#8211; even if it was \u0026#8220;just another diabetic.\u0026#8221;\nTo *us* it\u0026#8217;s a 9-5, and we stay calm because \u0026#8220;it\u0026#8217;s not my emergency.\u0026#8221; Well guess what? It\u0026#8217;s theirs. Every episode of Trauma was the most intense call ever, because that\u0026#8217;s the public\u0026#8217;s interaction with us \u0026#8211; and that\u0026#8217;s who the show was written for.\nThe bottom line is that I think a valuable opportunity is leaving us, and that as a jaded community we blew it. A lot of good could have come from it. We only have ourselves to blame for the perception the media and the public have of us. When we want to communicate with the public we need to remember that they\u0026#8217;re different from us \u0026#8211; they aren\u0026#8217;t in \u0026#8220;the know.\u0026#8221;\nGoodbye, Paramedic Nancy Carnahan.

Patient #2   As I walk in the door I can see the long tube for her supplemental oxygen snaking its way down the hall to her small bedroom. As I walk past the kitchen a hissing catches my attention: an oxygen concentrator running. The bedroom is equipped with a recliner, TV, and walker. She doesn\u0026#8217;t get around that easily. I can hear her gasping for air from the doorway. She says nothing, she can\u0026#8217;t, but the panic in her eyes tells me all I need to know. Her name was only a couple syllables, but that was too much to get out in a single breath. The normal light-hearted atmosphere we bring to calm a patient is gone. I do as I\u0026#8217;m told to assist in stabilising her before we whisk her off to hospital. In my robot mode of getting a d-stick, I unintentionally make eye contact with her as she attempts to sputter out a few syllables. She wants me to wipe her bloody nose \u0026#8211; the oxygen we put her on has dried her out. I clean her up and try to make her comfortable, asking for a humidifier. While I\u0026#8217;m doing this the medics are running a 12-lead and making a pin cushion of her arms trying to get a line. I\u0026#8217;m asked to bring in the gurney. As I cross the room my mind has a moment to wander. I look around and see pictures of children and grandchildren. She isn\u0026#8217;t in any of the portraits. Home blood pressure monitor. Caregiver says something about physical therapy earlier. She\u0026#8217;s been clearly been sick for a long time. This is someone\u0026#8217;s family member, and my heart pangs for a brief second as I realise these could be some of her last moments on Earth, shared only with me and 4 firemen. These thought\u0026#8217;s, while humanising, are ultimately unhelpful to providing emergent patient care. Engage reptilian brain: rescue doors open, trolley release, pull, drop legs, in front door, re-orient in the kitchen so it\u0026#8217;s facing the right way when I get to the bed, down hall, in bedroom. Use the sheet she\u0026#8217;s on to get her over. 1-2-3. Back to the rescue. Load and Go.   Verdict: Sick.   Epilogue:   It never ceases to amaze me how readily people who don\u0026#8217;t need ambulance services will call 9-1-1, but those who truly need them seem to wait until it\u0026#8217;s almost too late.

Talk to your grandparents if they\u0026#8217;re still around. You\u0026#8217;ll learn things too valuable to ever be committed to any book: teaching that transcend both language and generations.

Every summer I volunteer at a scout camp. This isn\u0026#8217;t regular summer camp \u0026#8211; it\u0026#8217;s more like Boy Scout boot camp. The training programme is called National Youth Leadership Training or NYLT. I originally went through the programme in 1999 when it was called Junior Leader Training. I\u0026#8217;ve been on staff ever since; this last week marked my 10th year.\nIn 2005 the transition was made from JLT to NYLT curriculum. A lot of the camp traditions I\u0026#8217;d come to love we\u0026#8217;re yanked. One of them was a large pioneering project. The old course had scouts build a bridge across a cove as a sort of \u0026#8220;final\u0026#8221; for the week. It was epic. It made them proud, and it was a big accomplishment. After the first year of NYLT, we adjusted the schedule to accommodate a new pioneering project. It\u0026#8217;s taken a long time, but the programe has finally gotten close to its former glory. This year was the first time since 2004 that the kids have completed the pioneering project without staff intervention \u0026#8211; i.e. the first time since NYLT was implemented that they have been able to do what every JLT course has for the last 20 years.\nI was so moved when they completed the project that I actually wept a little. These boys had gone from a group of complete strangers to a cohesive, productive group in just a few short days. They were able to organise themselves and build this fairly impressive structure. Who knows what they will be able to do with the future. Who knows what they will be able to accomplish.\nThat night at troop assembly, I looked over them \u0026#8211; rag tag group of smelly 13-14 year old boys. Normally I might stop my assessment at that \u0026#8211; but in that moment I saw something else. I saw possibilities in every single one of them. Endless possibilities they could achieve if they put their minds to it.\nI was humbled to be a part of an early experience in their life that hopefully taught them something about who and what they are, and who and what they can be.

This film was made as a kick-off for EMS week. The premiere party (another subject of itself) was a party. This film is designed for EMS personnel, by EMS personnel to re-affirm their faith in the profession and why they do what they do. Unfortunately, I don\u0026#8217;t think the film had a broad enough appeal to interest people outside the region. Half the thrill of the premiere was seeing people you know on a big screen. So was the film successful in achieving its objective? I think so. Is it what I wanted it to be? No. Can I fault it for that? No, because I had false expectations. What I want would be better achieved by TLC or the group that produced [Hopkins][3].\nNow\u0026#8230; the premiere party itself was more than I would have expected. Like I said about the film, this entire premiere event was a celebration of EMS providers about what we do. It was a fine night by all accounts \u0026#8211; but methinks there was too much ETOH. Every ticket to the premiere included 4 drink tickets. The event opened doors at 1830, and the film didn\u0026#8217;t screen until 2130. Some people were genuinely plastered by the time the film rolled. This was especially apparent in the Q\u0026amp;A after. To me, it was just a bit embarrassing. I know we\u0026#8217;re all \u0026#8220;among friends\u0026#8221; and whatnot, but I still don\u0026#8217;t think it was appropriate behaviour. When people know you\u0026#8217;re an EMT/Paramedic/Firefighter, there is a certain image you need to uphold. If you\u0026#8217;re in a bar off duty, out of uniform, and no one is the wiser, do what you like. However, if you\u0026#8217;re in a large group of people that are all assumed to be First Responders, you have a responsibility to maintain that image of honour and pride.\nAll in all, now understanding the intent of the event and the film \u0026#8211; that it was faith affirming for those in the profession \u0026#8211; I can say it was a success. I am personally, though, disappointed.\n ","date":1243022100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1243022100,"objectID":"7595e91a57e84cbabbce92b246a52092","permalink":"/p45/","publishdate":"2009-05-22T19:55:00Z","relpermalink":"/p45/","section":"post","summary":"warning: mixed theatre/film and EMS content ahead  On Monday I went to the \u0026#8220;[Level Zero][2]\u0026#8221; premiere.

Their agency responds to about 120,000 9-1-1 calls per year. Last year my agency was just shy of 600. CCFD is the proud home of Station 18 \u0026#8211; \u0026#8220;the pride of the strip\u0026#8221; \u0026#8211; which has the honour of being the busiest firehouse in the United States.\nAll it took was a quick call to Fire Administration and asking for the EMS coordinator, who after a brief conversation directed me to the EMS supervisor to find the actual station I would be posted at for the day. I wound up at station 23 in the heart of the ghetto of North Las Vegas. I was excited for the onslaught of crime, grime, and blood that awaited me as an overanxious newer EMT.\nI reported at 0900. We got our first call shortly after my arrival for a woman \u0026#8220;feeling sick.\u0026#8221; Code 1 alpha response. Snooze. I think I\u0026#8217;ve been on that call with my agency. The medic let me start doing a full patient evaluation, but eventually cut me off when the transport ambulance arrived. \u0026#8220;Okay, so what hospital do you want to go to?\u0026#8221; One of the unique things about a pay for transport system is that everyone \u0026#8220;should\u0026#8221; go to the hospital. The cost of transport is not figured into what is or is not in the patient\u0026#8217;s best interest.\nThe engine then went on a call for 23 yof with abdominal pain. WTF ru serious? I thought I left the world of volunteer EMS? The captain bet the engineer on the rescue a drink that the patient would be at least 300 pounds. Apparently she was not, and the captain sent a rookie to go pay the debt in fire service gold: mountain dew.\nThe third call was back pain coded as a charlie with code 3 response. \u0026#8220;Must be some really bad back pain.\u0026#8221; The guy has an irregular heart rhythm that was a fun ECG to look at. The transport medic got very excited about the degree of the block and the conduction ratio, the non conducted beats, etc. While I kept it to myself, I understood (and could see) everything he was talking about. The fire medic, however, made fun of transport medic. I could almost hear him say \u0026#8220;nerd alert\u0026#8221; under his breath. Back at the station the captain remarked, \u0026#8220;it\u0026#8217;s not really that hard. You ask if you want to go to the hospital and put them on oxygen. Start an IV if they\u0026#8217;re actually sick. The end.\u0026#8221;\nKeep in mind these were the only calls that occurred between 0900 and about 1700. I was allowed to stay at the station until 2200. The crew apologised that their clientele was disappointing today. I responded that I understood how that always seemed to work with ride-alongs. Depressed and exhausted, I was ready to give up and leave around 2100, but got into a conversation with the engine medic about a house he was building. At 2155, as I was gathering my things, the whole station was paged for a multiple shooting. 4 victims. One in the chest. Police report code 4 to enter.\nHell. Yeah.\nNormally my job is to grab the airway bag. When we arrive, the medic yells back, \u0026#8220;just get a backboard; we\u0026#8217;re getting out of here.\u0026#8221; The victim had a single superficial wound near his right clavicle. PD reported that they thought it was likely a ricochet. \u0026#8220;Hablas ingles?\u0026#8221; No, of course not, but AOx4 \u0026#8211; we think. Occlusive dressing on, even though it wasn\u0026#8217;t sucking let alone bleeding much. NRB on. Collar on. Roll. Back clear. Backboard under. Straps on. Gurney. Lift. Headbed. Into transport ambulance. Code 3. Go.\nIn transport I was attaching leads, spiking IV bags, adjusting drip rates, checking breath sounds, and monitoring LOC and airway. Being an intermediate it was awesome to understand every detail of what the medics were both doing and saying. My assessments and interventions were productive. I was helping this guy.\nIt was the closest to being alive that I\u0026#8217;ve felt in a long time. And on top of it the transport medic was smokin\u0026#8217; hot. The call was so good, I thought I needed a cigarette after \u0026#8211; and I don\u0026#8217;t smoke.\nYeah, that good.\nAfter that call, I had no doubt in my mind that I wanted to go to paramedic school. The longer I do theatre, the more bored I get with it. In the mean time it pays three times as well as any EMS job I could get, if I could get hired anywhere. However, this all occurs to me as I\u0026#8217;m sitting through a 4-day seminar for theatre-sound related training. At lunch I drifted off in a conversation when an ambulance went by. I\u0026#8217;m writing this post in class right now because I\u0026#8217;m fantasising about being back on the front lines, speeding around with lights and sirens blaring, making a difference.\nI hope this isn\u0026#8217;t some fleeting infatuation.

One of the biggest changes in drama for the last two decades is the confusion of morality. Melodrama used to be clear cut good v. bad. There was the white hat hero and the black mustache tie-you-to-the-train-tracks bad villain. Both were easily identifiable and there was nothing in between. Today\u0026#8217;s melodrama is an exploration of moral issues. What makes us good or bad? Is it what we do or why we do it? Think about this before you answer.\nWe all agree that Jack Bauer is a hero. Consider his actions. A lot of people consider what he does \u0026#8220;wrong,\u0026#8221; but we stand up and cheer for his because of his reasons for doing it. He frequently will sacrifice his own moral character for the great good of the safety of the nation.\nThis stands in contrast to \u0026#8220;the grotesque\u0026#8221; movement of the romantic period. The romantic period started blending different elements of characters. The characters themselves were, however, still very distinct and readily identifiable. In the 21st century, we don\u0026#8217;t know who is who.\n\u0026#8220;Sirens\u0026#8221; is no different. There are pirates and sirens. Criminals (particularly poignant given recent events) and mythical sex goddesses. Ironically, the Siren\u0026#8217;s ship is white \u0026#8211; normally symbolic of purity. The visual design of the pirate\u0026#8217;s vessel is clearly influenced by a Peter Pan \u0026#8220;lost boys\u0026#8221; style. The Sirens seduce the Pirates. Clearly in this performance the Pirates are the victims \u0026#8211; \u0026#8220;lost boys\u0026#8221; who are helpless to the seduction of women. This is also a sexual role reversal from what was portrayed just 20 years ago. Vampire literature (and other similarly sexual story lines) has always shown men as the aggressor \u0026#8211; but that\u0026#8217;s changed now.\nWho is good? Who is evil? Why are we motivated to do thing? What is the true measure of our character? The Pirates, ironically are standing up their honour. The Sirens are seeking purely after carnal desire. In the end the Sirens win. What is the show teaching? Immediate gratification is good. Impulse control is bad. Welcome to Vegas. We\u0026#8217;re here to help you with that \u0026#8211; for a small fee.\nSome things, though, will never change. The melodrama of the 18th and 19th centuries featured spectacle. It was all about putting on a big show \u0026#8211; bigger, better, louder. Epic. The 19th century featured a sub-genre called \u0026#8220;firefighter melodrama\u0026#8221; that was popular because they got to burn things on stage. The same is true with \u0026#8220;Sirens.\u0026#8221; As they\u0026#8217;ve proven on Mythbusters, it\u0026#8217;s always better to end with a bang.\nSo the bottom line is that \u0026#8220;Sirens of TI\u0026#8221; has been written in the melodramatic style because it\u0026#8217;s historically about escapism \u0026#8211; and guess what Vegas is trying to create. \u0026#8220;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\u0026#8221; LasVegas itself is performance.

No. Ride along climbs in, adrenaline pumping at the appropriate level now.\nOops.\nAppendix A: the actual call\nThe actual call could have been interesting. While a young male with chest pain screams \u0026#8220;anxiety\u0026#8221; to me, most young males aren\u0026#8217;t seeing a cardiologist and taking beta-blockers for a consistent disrhytmia and a family history of conduction disorders.\nHR 15o taken manually. 324mg ASA PO. O2 @ 15 lpm by NRB.

I give my hand-off to the Medic, who has us put the pt on City Fire\u0026#8217;s monitor. Sinus tac. The Medic zeroes in quickly on a diagnosis of anxiety. But the pt wants to go to Level-2 Regional Medical Centre just down the street. I\u0026#8217;m pretty sure after they got him in the Rescue that they started 12\u0026#8217;s bilaterally just because he annoyed them.\nI really wish band-aid brigade could do some Intermediate interventions. It would help us rule out a lot of things City Fire has to come for. But if there\u0026#8217;s one thing I\u0026#8217;ve learned, it\u0026#8217;s that we aren\u0026#8217;t trusted. Case in point below.\nAppendix B: playing hookie\nI keep a high GPA. That\u0026#8217;s because I go to class. Consistently. But a couple weeks ago I played hookie. That\u0026#8217;s right \u0026#8211; I\u0026#8217;ve been in college for 5 years and this was the first time I consciously decided not to go to class. *le gasp*\nSimmer down. I went to an EMS conference with NPP. I learned more there than I would have in class anyway. We talked to some people with LifeFlight.\nWhy does HEMS have such a visceral, romantic appeal? I think it\u0026#8217;s because it\u0026#8217;s the closest you can get to being a superhero \u0026#8211; actually flying in to save the day. The flight nurse we talked to offered as some posters that had their transport criteria and LZ protocols on them. We squealed with glee, taking copies for bedrooms (nerd alert), and one for the band-aid brigade office. The flight nurse informs us that this might actually come in handy. Although Level-2 Regional Medical Centre is two blocks away, \u0026#8220;in the event of an MCI,\u0026#8221; he informs us that he \u0026#8220;might be flying patients to other medical centres in the state.\u0026#8221; We ooh and ahh at the prospect, and take the HEMS poster back to our EMS director who happens to be at the conference with us. Our director (let\u0026#8217;s call him \u0026#8220;Fearless Leader\u0026#8221;) is generally a nice guy, but sometimes he\u0026#8217;s a little short with us. Especially via e-mail. The follow up conversation with our new \u0026#8220;toy\u0026#8221; (the poster) went something like this:\nNA and NPP: FL, FL! Looks what we got! Now can land a helicopter if something terrible ever happens! Hoo-rah!\nFL: You guys realise you won\u0026#8217;t ever do that. The cops will.\nNA and NPP: *whimper*\nYou might as well have told us there was no Santa Clause.\nAnother (more serious) example of not being trusted. For any \u0026#8220;difficulty breathing\u0026#8221; dispatch, City Fire is dispatched simultaneously. Unfortunately, this encompasses every college aged girl who ever has a panic attack. And we can\u0026#8217;t tell City Fire to cancel and stay at the Station to finish their movie.\nOh well.

On a call, we can hand each other a piece of equipment before the other asks for it. We know what line of questioning we\u0026#8217;re going down.

We laugh together. Sometimes too much. Sometimes inappropriately. She also wants to be a flight nurse, but is self-admittedly not super academic.

Well, for the last eight years of my life I\u0026#8217;ve been doing theatre professionally. I was good at it. So I pursued it in college and continued building my career. I\u0026#8217;ve done sound for Apple, Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Google, Sun Microsystems, Phyzer, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Green Day, Rage Against the Machine, and the San Francisco Opera and Symphony, just to name a few. I\u0026#8217;ve turned down opportunities to go on national musical theatre tours, etc. I\u0026#8217;m good at what I do.\nI\u0026#8217;ve also seen lots of people get pretty seriously hurt in professional theatre. I took my EMT-Basic class because I wanted to be better prepared for when things happened.\nUnfortunately, I liked it.\nI discovered this when I was a handful of classes short of finishing my theatre degree. Having transferred between a couple colleges, I\u0026#8217;m already taking 6 years (and \u0026gt;170 semester credits) to finish my undergrad. So no change of major for me. I am, however, taking chemistry, anatomy, physiology, etc., so I can continue my medical ambitions. If I choose to.\nMy pseudonym (Nerd Alert) is an official nickname from my EMT-Intermediate class. I\u0026#8217;m a theatre major, but I\u0026#8217;ve audited both anatomy and physiology. Why? I like knowing what I\u0026#8217;m doing for my patients and why it works. The problem with that? When people ask why this drug works for this, or why something is done this way, I answer it \u0026#8211; sometimes when even the instructor can\u0026#8217;t. Example:\nStudent: So why can\u0026#8217;t you give glucagon twice?\nInstructor: Because it uses up all the sugar stores.\nStudent: From where? The blood sugar is already low.\nInstructor: I don\u0026#8217;t know, it just uses them up and you can\u0026#8217;t give it again.\nNerd Alert: Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates glycogenolysis \u0026#8211; breaking down glycogen stores in the liver to be released in the blood stream. Once you\u0026#8217;ve used up the glycogen stores by giving glucagon, obviously you can\u0026#8217;t do it again.\nInstructor (in a playground sing-song): Nerd Alert! Nerd Alert! Nerd Alert!\nI\u0026#8217;m almost proud of that. Almost.\n ","date":1239499920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1239499920,"objectID":"44dca2dabffe632331d7cd27f0014f21","permalink":"/p6/","publishdate":"2009-04-12T01:32:00Z","relpermalink":"/p6/","section":"post","summary":"If you\u0026#8217;ve ever read a play, you know that it usually begins with a cast of characters \u0026#8211; sometimes called a dramatis persona.
