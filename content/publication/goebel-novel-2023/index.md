abstract: 'Introduction:Early detection of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
  (STEMI) on the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) improves patient outcomes. Current
  software algorithms optimize sensitivity but have a high false-positive rate. The
  authors propose an algorithm to improve the specificity of STEMI diagnosis in the
  prehospital setting.Methods:A dataset of prehospital ECGs with verified outcomes
  was used to validate an algorithm to identify true and false-positive software interpretations
  of STEMI. Four criteria implicated in prior research to differentiate STEMI true
  positives were applied: heart rate textless130, QRS textless100, verification of
  ST-segment elevation, and absence of artifact. The test characteristics were calculated
  and regression analysis was used to examine the association between the number of
  criteria included and test characteristics.Results:There were 44,611 cases available.
  Of these, 1,193 were identified as STEMI by the software interpretation. Applying
  all four criteria had the highest positive likelihood ratio of 353 (95% CI, 201-595)
  and specificity of 99.96% (95% CI, 99.93-99.98), but the lowest sensitivity (14%;
  95% CI, 11-17) and worst negative likelihood ratio (0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.89). There
  was a strong correlation between increased positive likelihood ratio (r2 = 0.90)
  and specificity (r2 = 0.85) with increasing number of criteria.Conclusions:Prehospital
  ECGs with a high probability of true STEMI can be accurately identified using these
  four criteria: heart rate textless130, QRS textless100, verification of ST-segment
  elevation, and absence of artifact. Applying these criteria to prehospital ECGs
  with software interpretations of STEMI could decrease false-positive field activations,
  while also reducing the need to rely on transmission for physician over-read. This
  can have significant clinical and quality implications for Emergency Medical Services
  (EMS) systems.'
