I recently responded to two different patients with the same complaint: shortness of breath.

<div>
  Patient #1
</div>

<div>
  As soon as we walked in the door she filled our ears with tales about how &#8220;I&#8217;ve been short of breath for a few days but today was worse and my blood pressure is all over the place when I gain or lose weight and right now I&#8217;m heavier so it&#8217;s higher and there&#8217;s some tightness in my chest and which hospital am I going to and can my significant other come and what about my cat.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  Verdict: Not sick.
</div>

<div>
  Patient #2
</div>

<div>
  As I walk in the door I can see the long tube for her supplemental oxygen snaking its way down the hall to her small bedroom. As I walk past the kitchen a hissing catches my attention: an oxygen concentrator running. The bedroom is equipped with a recliner, TV, and walker. She doesn&#8217;t get around that easily. I can hear her gasping for air from the doorway. She says nothing, she can&#8217;t, but the panic in her eyes tells me all I need to know. Her name was only a couple syllables, but that was too much to get out in a single breath. The normal light-hearted atmosphere we bring to calm a patient is gone. I do as I&#8217;m told to assist in stabilising her before we whisk her off to hospital. In my robot mode of getting a d-stick, I unintentionally make eye contact with her as she attempts to sputter out a few syllables. She wants me to wipe her bloody nose &#8211; the oxygen we put her on has dried her out. I clean her up and try to make her comfortable, asking for a humidifier. While I&#8217;m doing this the medics are running a 12-lead and making a pin cushion of her arms trying to get a line. I&#8217;m asked to bring in the gurney. As I cross the room my mind has a moment to wander. I look around and see pictures of children and grandchildren. She isn&#8217;t in any of the portraits. Home blood pressure monitor. Caregiver says something about physical therapy earlier. She&#8217;s been clearly been sick for a long time. This is someone&#8217;s family member, and my heart pangs for a brief second as I realise these could be some of her last moments on Earth, shared only with me and 4 firemen. These thought&#8217;s, while humanising, are ultimately unhelpful to providing emergent patient care. Engage reptilian brain: rescue doors open, trolley release, pull, drop legs, in front door, re-orient in the kitchen so it&#8217;s facing the right way when I get to the bed, down hall, in bedroom. Use the sheet she&#8217;s on to get her over. 1-2-3. Back to the rescue. Load and Go.

  Verdict: Sick.

  Epilogue:
</div>

<div>
  It never ceases to amaze me how readily people who <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> need ambulance services will call 9-1-1, but those who truly need them seem to wait until it&#8217;s almost too late.
</div>

<div>
  Patient 2 is part of a dying breed (literally) &#8211; an older generation with a little something called self-reliance. They don&#8217;t want to be a bother. They just want to have their peace. I respect and applaud them for that, especially when put in contrast to today&#8217;s attitude of entitlement.

  Talk to your grandparents if they&#8217;re still around. You&#8217;ll learn things too valuable to ever be committed to any book: teaching that transcend both language and generations.
