If this was in blue it would be my LifeFlight sweater. It&#8217;s one of my most prised possessions.

It was too hot to wear it today walking between my seminar and the train station. I was actually annoyed by this &#8211; not because I had to carry my coat, but because I couldn&#8217;t <span style="font-style:italic;">wear</span> this one.

What does that say about me?
