Tones drop.

<div>
  EMS respond on a mid 20&#8217;s male having an asthma attack. Patient does not have their inhaler.
</div>

<div>
  First though: This could be <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">lejit</span>.
</div>

<div>
  Second though: But probably not.
</div>

<div>
  Off to the scene we scream in the gutless wonder. When we arrive on scene I talk to the officer who is already there.
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Um&#8230;so when I reported asthma&#8230; I meant <em>asthma</em>.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  I glance at the patient. There is no apparent distress. He appears to be &#8220;status <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">dramaticus</span>.&#8221; In other words, there is no medical problem, but instead this is mostly likely anxiety related. That&#8217;s fine &#8211; we all have <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">stressors</span>. Sometimes people just need to be talked down. That&#8217;s a legitimate intervention.
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Got it&#8230;asthma with a lowercase &#8216;a&#8217; &#8220;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;You got it&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  Because this is a simple call with no real life threats, I will let the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">probie</span> I&#8217;m with take patient care. His interaction with the patient goes something like this.
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">probie</span> with the band-aid brigade, what&#8217;s going on today?&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  Cold Stare
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Hey are you doing okay?&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  Cold Stare
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Heellloooooo</span>?&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;GO AWAY! I&#8217;M FINE! I HATE YOU!&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    I reach for the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">pulseox</span>. This was dispatched and coded for difficulty breathing, so I should document that he was, in fact, &#8220;fine.&#8221; I&#8217;m within an inch of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">patient&#8217;s</span> finger when he erupts with a guttural scream not heard outside the deepest pits of hell until this very moment.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8220;GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME!&#8221;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I whip off my glove, put the pulseox on myself, and hold it directly in front of his face. &#8220;It goes like this. It won&#8217;t hurt you. Just take a deep breath.&#8221;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    With a pout the patient thrusts me an index finger. I get a quick reading and pull it off just as he starts screaming again.
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Probie</span> gives me the deer-in-the-headlights look. I step in. Here is the abridged version of the dialogue:
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">NerdAlert</span>. I know you&#8217;re not happy we&#8217;re here, but <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">someone&#8217;s</span> called 911 so we need to make sure you&#8217;re okay.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;I&#8217;M FINE LEAVE ME ALONE!&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Right. We need to make <em>sure</em> you&#8217;re fine.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;GO AWAY I HATE YOU!&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  By now I have been on-scene for several minutes and have not gotten very far. I sit for a moment, pondering where to go next, absorbing some more verbal abuse, when I remember something from an acting class I was forced to take for my major. In a situation like this, where a scene has grown stagnant, it is often appropriate to change &#8220;tactics&#8221; &#8211; or in other words try to get what you want in a different way.
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Well you know what?<strong> You </strong>dont&#8217;t want me here and <strong>I</strong> don&#8217;t want to be here. So the sooner you let me do <strong>my</strong> job the sooner <strong>you</strong> can leave. <strong>Alright</strong>?&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;FINE!&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;GOOD! Now let my partner take your blood pressure.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;I&#8217;M FINE!&#8221;
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;Fine people let us take their blood pressure. <strong>Now roll up your sleeve!</strong>&#8220;
</div>

<div>
  Patient complies with appropriate dramatic flair.
</div>

<div>
  The officer, standing behind the patient this entire time, gives me a big thumbs up.
</div>

<div>
  Sometimes you just have to switch tactics.
