This site was made in Rstudio using Hugo, blogdown, git, and netlify. Here are the resources  I used when building the site.

I mainly followed [Allison Hill's guide.](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) She also has a [number of other posts on blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/tags/blogdown/) that are helpful.

I occasionally cross referenced [Amber Thomas' guide.](https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/)

If you need the mile high view before you dive in, [read Chi Zhang's post.](https://andreaczhang.rbind.io/post/my-1st-blogpost/)

You'll of course need the [official Hugo refence](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) and [creating websites with R markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html).

Happy web building!
