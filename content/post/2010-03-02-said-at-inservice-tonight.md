We were discussing possible causes for sycope in paediatric patients:

NA: Could be cardiac. Maybe a congenital heart defect?
  
Lecturer: Yes, very good. Let&#8217;s define that word for anyone who doesn&#8217;t know it. For starters, it has nothing to do with the genitals. (collective giggle) This is your heart. Here I&#8217;ll make the left ventricle bigger so it&#8217;s anatomically correct. And here are the pacemakers.

Face palm. I used to wonder why people make fun of us for being &#8220;just BLS.&#8221;
