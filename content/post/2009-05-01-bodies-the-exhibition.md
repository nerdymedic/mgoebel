Today I went to &#8220;Bodies &#8211; The Exhibition&#8221; in Las Vegas at the the Luxor. Most people sort of glanced at things and stayed an arms length away form the cadavers. They seemed to be I got as close as I possibly could (inches) from the cadavers and read every word of every exhibit. At one point, wtih my face inches from an opened thoracic cavity, I muttered &#8220;these don&#8217;t smell like cadavers&#8221; under my breath and received strange glances from the other people in the hall.

The human body is an amazingly complex and beautiful machine. So many things happen in so many places at so many levels. So many levels of complexity and function drill down perfectly in seamless functions like ballrom dance and playing musical instruments &#8211; it&#8217;s like the ideal ICS implimentation.

I wasn&#8217;t terribly impressed with the detail of the exhibition. There wasn&#8217;t a whole lot I didn&#8217;t know already &#8211; which isn&#8217;t saying much. It was still, however, a very educational experience. It&#8217;s one thing to know how things are hooked up; it&#8217;s another to actually see them that way. Sitting on front of you.

I think the cadaver lab at my university is cooler though. You can actually handle parts and pieces and look at them in any orientation you want. Being stuck behind plexiglass was frustrating. I wanted a pair of gloves, a spay bottle, and a probe.

On the spiritual side of things, the exhibit really took my eyes to the heavens. The human body is truly beautiful. Every breath we take and every beat of our heart is a miracle. Indeed all things indicate there is a God.

On a side note, winner for best comment in the guest book of the walkout area was: &#8220;Our muscles look like turkey meat. I&#8217;m never eating turkey again.&#8221; Heh. I have a sudden graving for wings&#8230;
