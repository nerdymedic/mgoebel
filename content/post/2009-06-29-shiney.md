I make a reasonable ammount of money. I used to have a blackberry, but the more I tried to use the internet the more annoyed I got with its limitations. So yesterday I took the plunge and went to the Apple store. I had to wait in line for an hour. I plunked down my $199 and walked out, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve put it down much since.

It does so many cool things to help me remain connected, feed my ADD, and just have fun. I don&#8217;t think it will improve my patient care, except for a couple cool pharmacology applications, but it does keep me a little distracted. And I can&#8217;t remember the last time I bought something for myself &#8211; so why not.

And I can post to my blog from it!
