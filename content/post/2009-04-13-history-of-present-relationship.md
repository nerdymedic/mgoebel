When it comes time in a relationship to &#8220;define the relationship&#8221; or <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">DTR</span>, you may find it useful to remember to use <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">OPQRST</span>.

Onset &#8211; How did this start? Did you start liking me suddenly? Slowly?

Provokes &#8211; Does anything I do make you like me more or less? Has it been getting better or worse lately?

Quality &#8211; If you had to describe how you like me in one word, what would it be?

Radiates &#8211; Can you point to where I seem to affect you? Just your heart?

Severity &#8211; If you had to rate our relationship on a scale of 1 to 10&#8230;

Time &#8211; When exactly did this come about? Is this the first time you&#8217;ve liked someone this way?

There. Now you have a history of the present relationship.
