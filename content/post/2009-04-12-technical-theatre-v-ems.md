I like to think that I keep a level head on a scene and do the best assessment I can do. I&#8217;ve also noticed that EMTs and theatre technicians share the same of sense of humour.

<span style="font-style:italic;">Technical Theatre</span>
  
In a live performance environment, you have one shot to get things right. Lives are not at stake, but there&#8217;s enough money involved that people act like there are. On a Broadway show people are paying hundreds of dollars per seat. Missing one wireless microphone pickup could cost the performance big time. I strap thousands of dollars worth of equipment to performers that are going to sweat and dance with it. Sometimes the shows I work on are broadcast live &#8211; lots of room for &#8220;oops&#8221; there. But, I don&#8217;t let it bother me. No matter how high profile, a show is just a little indoor skit. Sometimes they&#8217;re a little bigger, but when it comes down to it, you do the best you can, and it&#8217;s all you can do. You&#8217;d better be good at what you do so you can do it: fast, in the dark, under pressure, and perfectly.

It really takes the same kind of person to do either, which is why it hasn&#8217;t been a difficult transition for me. It&#8217;s just a new skill set. So technical theatre and EMS &#8211; not so different.
