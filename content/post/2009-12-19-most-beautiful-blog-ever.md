Part of the reason I did so well in anatomy was because I developed a deep love for the human body and the beauty of it&#8217;s construction. It goes along with the whole &#8220;nerd&#8221; persona. I stumbled across a new blog the other day, and it is a sort of anatomy &#8220;nerdvana.&#8221;

[Street Anatomy][1] features all sorts of beautiful uses of anatomy in medicine, art, and design. I particularly enjoy their &#8220;Anatomic Fashion Friday&#8221; feature. I like it so much, I made some last minute additions to my christmas list. The site also features beautiful art work. Some of it I&#8217;m actually going to buy prints of. Some of it will just grace my desktop as wallpaper. So please, click, enjoy, geek out.

_Sidebar: _I&#8217;m not the only one who enjoy this stuff. After I shared it with my friend [Dani, she posted it on her blog][2]. And she&#8217;s cool. So neener-neener.

I found [this][3] series [featured on the blog][4] particularly gorgeous. It fuses two of my favourite things: anatomy and technical drawing/sketching.
