I&#8217;m trying to intubate our code manikin on the floor; against the wall. I&#8217;m really struggling to see anything. My arm is shaking. I&#8217;m sweating. This is a lot harder than when it&#8217;s on the gurney or a well-lit table at waist level.

NPP is visiting class tonight. She starts poking and prodding my neck &#8211; while I&#8217;m riding this bull of a manakin at the airway rodeo.

&#8220;Stop palpating my jugular!&#8221;
