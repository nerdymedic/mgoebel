Last night it was unseasonably cold, so I was wearing my reflective EMS jacket because it&#8217;s warm and cozy. I was sitting at Starbucks with a friend talking about <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">health care</span> reform &#8211; which she&#8217;s actually <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">involved</span> with in her job at the House in DC.

It was an <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">MVA</span> involving 4 cars and as many patients. It happened right in front of me. As soon as it happened, I ran into the intersection and started checking on the occupants of the vehicles. Only one car had its airbags deployed. Everyone denied injury.

An officer arrived quickly, and I advised him that airbags had deployed in one vehicle but that no one was seriously injury and that Fire and EMS could probably downgrade their response from Code3. I knew we were two blocks from the closest Fire station and three blocks from the closest ambulance post. Lights and sirens wouldn&#8217;t have really improved the response time &#8211; but alas, I think the people demand it. A fire engine and ambulance came flying in, lights and sirens blazing in all the glory that I don&#8217;t get to have. Having made no difference, I sulked back to Starbucks to tend to my caramel apple cider.

By the time the Big Ambulance Company arrived on scene, Fire had already started cleanup of the fluids leaking from the mini-van that was hit head on. The ambulance medic actually convinced one of the people <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">involved</span> in the accident to get in the back of the rig. They probably pulled the old &#8220;an <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">ambulance</span> ride is cheaper than a funeral&#8221; gag. I&#8217;ll bet they even called it a trauma activation \*rolls eyes\*  - because look at that mechanism of  injury.

I mean, I guess it&#8217;s good no one was hurt because I didn&#8217;t have any actual kit with me besides gloves. Maybe an arrest? Bystander CPR makes a difference.

Yeah&#8230;no. None for you.
