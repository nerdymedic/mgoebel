I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to get involved with the EM:RAP crew, helping with their monthly live broadcasts. At the last show, they had a segment on DeWinter T-waves where Stuart Swadron was using an article I wrote as part of his presentation! I ended getting interviewed and answering some EKG questions.

Check out the segment [here][1], the [publication here][2], and the [FOAM content][3] at [LITFL][4].
