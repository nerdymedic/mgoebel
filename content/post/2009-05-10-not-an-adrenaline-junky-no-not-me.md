Tonight I went indoor skydiving &#8211; Oh. my. wow.

130mph wind is a lot. You get to fly. For reals. I had to seriously concentrate to keep my posture, and my back is a little sore, but I&#8217;ll definitely go again. Nursing Programme Partner insists that we go after her sister&#8217;s wedding reception later this summer.

Granted, these are sensations a flight medic/nurse probably never wants to experience outside of a plexi-glass tube.

So do I love EMS or am I an adrenaline junky? I might have a chance to work at Google this summer doing my usual sound/technical theatre stuff. Regular hours, decent pay, awesome cafeteria, and cute girls. But I don&#8217;t think I would be happy. I want to be in the streets scraping people off the side-walks and taking care of them. I want the glory or lights and sirens. Given the choice of working for Google and taking 911 calls, I would jump on the ambulance in a second, even if it meant less pay.

I think maybe the reason I liked doing theatre so much was because it was sort of part-time. Work a week here and then have a month off. Work 3 on 3 off. Work 4 on 7 off &#8211; or however it sorts out. EMS shift work would be similar&#8230; I could handle having 4 days off a week and doing 3/12&#8217;s.

What do I want to be when I grow up? What do I want to be this summer?
