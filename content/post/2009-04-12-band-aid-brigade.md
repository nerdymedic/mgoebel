I yearn for a decent call. When I hear the fire station closest to campus get paged for a medical, I start salivating like a wild animal. I see red. In my head I start running through ACLS trees, timing compressions, considering the fastest way to get across campus given the traffic patterns for the time of day. And then&#8230; it&#8217;s not on campus. Auto-ped&#8230;two out of our response area.

Maybe City Fire will call for mutual aid&#8230;.yeah right&#8230;.they&#8217;d call the next state over before that ever happened.

Seriously? I know if you&#8217;re riding a bike in this town you go to school here. You couldn&#8217;t have gotten hurt on campus instead? FML.

Our tones go off moments later&#8230;blood pressure spikes&#8230;standby for medical&#8230;adrenaline released&#8230;.blood floods my legs&#8230;ready to sprint to someone&#8217;s aid. Dispatch keys up&#8230;Sprained ankle. FML.

Someday I&#8217;ll be a real EMS provider &#8211; i.e., more than a buffer between the Fire Department and typical <s>idiocy</s>Â BLS we respond to. I&#8217;d like to really help someone.

Fly in to save the day&#8230; is that my dream? I don&#8217;t know. But for now, I do what I can with the campus band-aid brigade, snatching you from the jaws of death in our gutless wonder from 0700 to 2300 most days.
