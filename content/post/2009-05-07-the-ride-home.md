I&#8217;ve spent the entire day at a high-end professional speaker manufacturer learning about sound system measurement, alignment, and tuning. There was a time when I would have really enjoyed this. Instead I find it hard to concentrate.

On the train ride home I&#8217;m listening to EMS CE lecture podcasts. I&#8217;m reading EMS blogs. I&#8217;m writing in my blog about how much I love EMS.

If this is what I choose to do in my spare time, why don&#8217;t I just go in head first? What am I afraid of &#8211; actually enjoying what I do?
