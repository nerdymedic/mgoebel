INT. &#8212; NERD ALERT&#8217;S APARTMENT. MID-DAY.

FLATMATE 1 walks in, leans over FLATMATE 2 to get his laptop, knocks daiquiri off coffee table on to carpet. Que EVERYONE scrambling to clean it up.

In the process FLATMATE 1 throws a door open to get to the rags. At this point it&#8217;s discovered that for the past 8 months this door &#8211; when fully opened &#8211; could nail the 42&#8243; flat-screen HDTV. It does.

Que NA screaming like he&#8217;s just seen a puppy get assassinated. The centre speaker of the surround system is knocked into the wall behind the TV.

Not 30 seconds after the ordeal NA swigs his root beer, forgetting it was full. The foam fizzes up and quickly overwhelms his ability to keep it in his cheeks, spraying across the floor as he sprints for the sink. He laughs so hard it comes out of every orifice of his face.

and, scene.

FML.
