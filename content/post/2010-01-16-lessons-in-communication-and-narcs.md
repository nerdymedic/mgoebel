I&#8217;m responding to a sports injury, paged as a broken arm. Upon arrival we quickly triangulate the patient&#8217;s location from the screams.

I assume patient care. The probie who would normally be interfacing with the patient has a sort of glassy look that says. &#8220;OMFG a real injured person!&#8221; Had I allowed him to begin his assessment, it would have quickly deteriorated into &#8220;um&#8230;do you have any allergies?&#8221; without having even touched the patient. I&#8217;ve noticed that new EMT&#8217;s have a strong tendency to do this.

I expose the extremity. She has an extra elbow. I need to remove a guard to see if the fracture is open or closed.

NA: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut this off.&#8221;
  
Patient, looking over: &#8220;WHAT?! Is it that bad?!&#8221;
  
NA: &#8220;Oh, um. I meant this guard type-y thingy.&#8221;

Add that one to the &#8220;oops list.&#8221; Lesson learned about using precise language.

I&#8217;m again caught off guard by the strong correlation between dispatch information and the actual call. Twice now? Weird.

The Fire Department arrives to transport the patient to hospital. I&#8217;ve completed my assessment, but held off splinting so they could first provide some pain relief. 10mg of morphine later, her screams and grimace have been converted to moans and a sort of glassy-faced grin.

Patient: &#8220;My arm feels fine now. Do I still have to go to the hospital?&#8221;
  
Medic, clapping O2 mask on her: &#8220;Um, yeah.&#8221;

I <s>bite my tongue to stifle my laughter</s>Â professionally maintain my composure with the Fire Crew (who seems to be having the same challenge) and help lift the patient onto the stretcher.
