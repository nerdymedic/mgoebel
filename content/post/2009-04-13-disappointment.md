My posts are not in the order they necessarily occur(ed) in. Since I&#8217;ll likely be posting about previous events for a while, they&#8217;re in the order that they cross my mind.

I&#8217;ve put my heart and soul into band-aid brigade EMS here in my little town. In two semester I&#8217;ve put in over 400 hours of documented shift time (more than twice what&#8217;s required), a lot of other time, cut class to go to CME opportunities, listened to hundreds of hours of medical podcasts, and generally done everything I can to provider better patient care and uplift and educate the people I run with.

So when they invited people to apply for supervisor positions next year, I was excited. I wanted more opportunities to educate, challenge, and uplift people in my service. I&#8217;ve spent almost a decade as an active staff member in Boy Scout leadership camps. I&#8217;m an experienced teacher. I don&#8217;t think you could ask for someone more passionate or qualified.

In my interview I mentioned my desire to educate and reform. Fearless Leader (our EMS director) asked exactly what I meant. So I quickly threw out a couple suggestions about doing call reviews during our weekly meetings, etc.

Well, I didn&#8217;t get the position. Who did? A bunch of people that do the bare minimum. Also, imagine my surprise in class last week when Fearless Leader announces that we will be doing &#8220;grand rounds&#8221; (a gussied up word for call reviews) form time to time. Great. He&#8217;s also mentioned implementing some of the other ideas I brought up in my interview.

If I had such great ideas, why not put me in a position to execute them? Why not call me a training officer? Honestly I feel a little betrayed or undercut. Is it wrong to feel that way? Is it wrong to almost resent the people who did get it because I feel significantly more qualified?

The bigger question is: does it matter? The answer to that is probably not.
