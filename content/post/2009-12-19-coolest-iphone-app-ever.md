Ever wish you could visit the cadaver lab in your spare minutes between classes? Or even during a boring class (**cough** dramatic literature **cough**).

<div>
  There&#8217;s an app for that.Short-partner told me about an iPhone app a long while ago that sounded pretty cool&#8230; but because I was frequently dropped on my head as a child, I never got around to looking it up. Then it was <a href="http://streetanatomy.com/2009/12/08/pocket-cadaver/">featured</a> on my new favourite blog <a href="http://www.streetanatomy.com/">Street Anatomy</a>.</p>

    Introducing &#8220;Pocket Cadaver.&#8221; OMG I wish I&#8217;d gotten around to finding this while I was still taking anatomy. You can do through all these layers of the beautifully done cadaver dissection, highlight and label structures, rotate, zoom in and out, and even <em>search</em> for a structure and have it show you where it is. Amazing! I just wish the imagery were higher resolution. Maybe in an update.
