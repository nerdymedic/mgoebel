I recently had a chance to help with an EMT Basic class. I was asked to teach spinal immobilisation.

I was grinding my teeth the whole time.

Why do we still teach to immobilise based on mechanism? Why do we seem to think that spinal immobilisation is a completely benign procedure? Why don&#8217;t we teach our students to actually assess the PATIENT? Why aren&#8217;t we teaching them better or new physical assessment techniques? Why don&#8217;t we teach them to think?

Our textbooks are a few years old. They took several years to write. They were written based on accepted information and studies that were old at the time of writing. Net result: Our latest graduates have an outdated education when they finish their course.

They&#8217;re also tested on that outdated information by all the regulating bodies. That outdated information is our &#8220;standard of care.&#8221;

Why are we holding ourselves back? As it stands now, I think EMS is it&#8217;s own worst enemy.
