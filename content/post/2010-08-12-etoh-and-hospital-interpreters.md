In EMS and the ED many situations involve &#8220;2 beers.&#8221;

Similarly, in the outpatient clinic when you have a patient that doesn&#8217;t speak English, they will bring a family member to interpret. That family member _will_, however, have 2 kids.

They will cry.

They will touch things they shouldn&#8217;t.

Why do such things come in pairs? The world may never know.
