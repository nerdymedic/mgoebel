Sometimes it sucks to fly, especially with &#8220;that lady.&#8221; Maybe she&#8217;s realted to sumdood. Here is an open letter to, &#8220;that lady:&#8221;

Dear &#8220;that lady,&#8221;

I kow you need to get places, because you seem to be on _every_ flight I ever take. It&#8217;s odd, because you never look the same. Must be expensive to change your appearance so radically that often. Let me offer some friendly advice to make your next flight more enjoyable &#8211; mostly for me, because I know you&#8217;re blisfully unaware of the effects your behaviour has on others.

If have the need to transport something the size of a dead yak, kindly check it. it will _not_ fit in the overhead bin. PS &#8211; It also freaks me out when you try to slam the plastic bin shut to make it fit. I  feel like it&#8217;s going to break.

You don&#8217;t need to be in the first boarding group, so stop throwing a fit when you aren&#8217;t. _If_ your bags are appropriately sized we can all fit. And try sitting somewhere other than the front for a change &#8211; that way you can hold up less than the entire plan while struggling to fit your animal carcas into the overhead bin.

Once you&#8217;ve thinned out your bag a bit so it can be crammed into overhead storage, that junk on your lap also has to go. Don&#8217;t get combative when you&#8217;re told it needs to be stowed. This includes any protest about needing &#8220;my knitting&#8221; or snacks for &#8220;my blood sugar&#8221; &#8211; this of course spoken between fist fulls of said snack. If you lost some weight, I can almost guarantee your blood sugar would be less of a problem.

When the flight attendant poked you to see if you were alive for the drink service, I was secrety hoping you weren&#8217;t. I think she felt the same way, since when you didn&#8217;t rouse initially and she asked me to be her &#8220;witness.&#8221;

One last thing, if you have an emergency, I am so not helping you.

PS &#8211; I&#8217;ll call ahead to make sure we&#8217;ve got extrication and heavy rescue when we land so there&#8217;s a chance of getting your bag out of the bin.
