A 47-year-old man was found in cardiac arrest and resuscitation was initiated. As no response was achieved, the efforts were withdrawn and final registered cardiac rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. Fifteen minutes later the patient was found to be normotensive and breathing spontaneously. The patient made a poor neurological recovery and died 3 months after the arrest. The authors are unable to give an explanation to the event, but suspect the effect of adrenaline combined with mild hypothermia to have contributed to the self-defibrillation of the myocardium.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	title = {Update of a {Systematic} {Review} of {Autoresuscitation} {After} {Cardiac} {Arrest}},
	volume = {46},
	doi = {10.1097/CCM.0000000000002920},
	abstract = {Objectives:
There has been a growth in publications focusing on the phenomena of autoresuscitation in recent years. In 2010, we systematically reviewed the medical literature with the primary objective of summarizing the evidence on the timing of autoresuscitation. Healthcare
professionals have continued to voice concerns regarding the potential for autoresuscitation. With this in mind, the objective of this brief report is to update the results of our original review of autoresuscitation. 
Data Sources:
We applied the same search strategy described
in our original article to update our findings to include articles published from January 2009 to September 2016. 
Study Selection and Data Extraction:
We screened an additional 1,859 citations, after duplicates were removed, and then assessed 46 full-text articles for eligibility,
from which 15 studies were included for data extraction. 
Data Synthesis:
During the time period of this review, there have been 1) 10 additional adult and three pediatric case reports of autoresuscitation in patients after cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; in
those cases with continuous monitoring and confirmation of circulation, the longest events are reported to be 10 and 2 minutes, respectively for adults and children; 2) six adults (4\%, total n = 162) with autoresuscitation events reported from two observational studies and one chart
review of patients undergoing withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; the longest time reported to be 89 seconds with electrocardiogram and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and 3 minutes with electrocardiogram monitoring only; 3) 12 pediatric patients studied with vital sign monitoring
during withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy without any reports of autoresuscitation. 
Conclusions:
Although case reports of autoresuscitation are hampered by variability in observation and monitoring techniques, autoresuscitation has now been reported in adults and children,
and there appears to be a distinction in timing between failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Although additional prospective studies are required to clarify the frequency and predisposing factors associated with this phenomenon, clinical decision-making
regarding patient management under uncertainty is required nonetheless. Both adult and pediatric healthcare professionals should be aware of the possibility of autoresuscitation and monitor their patients accordingly before diagnosing death.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
        Controversies regarding the process and timing of the determination of death for controlled organ donation after circulatory death persist. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a prospective, observational study of continuous monitoring of vital signs for 30 minutes after the clinical determination of death in five Canadian ICUs. Waveform data were analyzed.
        Design: 
        Prospective observational cohort study.
        Setting: 
        One pediatric and four adult Canadian ICUs.
        Patients: 
        One month of age or older, admitted to the ICU, and for whom a consensual decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies had been made, with an anticipation of imminent death.
        Interventions: 
        None.
        Measurements and Main Results: 
        Invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and oxygen saturation plethysmography activity were recorded and reviewed for 30 minutes after declaration of death. Feasibility was assessed (recruitment, consent rate, protocol compliance, and staff satisfaction). Of 188 subjects screened over 16 months, 41 subjects were enrolled (87\% consent rate). Data collection was complete for 30 subjects (73\% protocol compliance). In four subjects, arterial blood pressure resumed following cessation of activity. The longest period of cessation of arterial blood pressure before resumption was 89 seconds. The duration of resumed activity ranged from 1 to 172 seconds. No cases of sustained resumption of arterial blood pressure activity were recorded, and no instances of clinical autoresuscitation were reported. In nearly all patients (27 of 30), electrocardiogram activity continued after the disappearance of arterial blood pressure.
        Conclusions: 
        This is the first observational study to prospectively collect waveform data for 30 minutes after the declaration of death. A future larger study may support initial data suggesting that circulatory function does not resume after more than 89 seconds of absence. Furthermore, persistence of cardiac electrical activity with the documented absence of circulation may not be relevant to declaration of death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND We observed an apparent increase in the rate of device thrombosis among patients who received the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device, as compared with preapproval clinical-trial results and initial experience. We investigated the occurrence of pump thrombosis and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, LDH levels presaging thrombosis (and associated hemolysis), and outcomes of different management strategies in a multi-institutional study.
METHODS We obtained data from 837 patients at three institutions, where 895 devices were implanted from 2004 through mid-2013; the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 55±14 years. The primary end point was confirmed pump thrombosis. Secondary end points were confirmed and suspected thrombosis, longitudinal LDH levels, and outcomes after pump thrombosis.
RESULTS A total of 72 pump thromboses were confirmed in 66 patients; an additional 36 thromboses in unique devices were suspected. Starting in approximately March 2011, the occurrence of confirmed pump thrombosis at 3 months after implantation increased from 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 3.4) to 8.4\% (95\% CI, 5.0 to 13.9) by January 1, 2013. Before March 1, 2011, the median time from implantation to thrombosis was 18.6 months (95\% CI, 0.5 to 52.7), and from March 2011 onward, it was 2.7 months (95\% CI, 0.0 to 18.6). The occurrence of elevated LDH levels within 3 months after implantation mirrored that of thrombosis. Thrombosis was presaged by LDH levels that more than doubled, from 540 IU per liter to 1490 IU per liter, within the weeks before diagnosis. Thrombosis was managed by heart transplantation in 11 patients (1 patient died 31 days after transplantation) and by pump replacement in 21, with mortality equivalent to that among patients without thrombosis; among 40 thromboses in 40 patients who did not undergo transplantation or pump replacement, actuarial mortality was 48.2\% (95\% CI, 31.6 to 65.2) in the ensuing 6 months after pump thrombosis.

Coagulopathy and bleeding are the most common complications occurring in up to 50\% of ECMO patients. Loss of flow and hypotension from loss of volume or profound vasodilation after ECMO initiation need to be managed accordingly. Oxygenator malfunction can occur, and clinicians must be able to recognize the indicators of this complication promptly. Loss of pulsatility, low end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), and differential hypoxia are common complications in venoarterial ECMO. In addition, an air embolism is life-threatening on venoarterial ECMO but may be better tolerated in the setting of venovenous ECMO. Recirculation in venovenous ECMO leads to circulation of poorly oxygenated blood and must be recognized and addressed. Lastly, pump failure, circuit rupture, and decannulation are devastating complications. Over the last decade, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has accelerated rapidly,1, 2, 3 providing support for patients in severe respiratory or cardiac failure. With ongoing clinical experience and improvements in technology, the indications for ECMO are increasing.4 Many areas are developing centralized ECMO centers to serve their surrounding communities.5, 6, 7 To use a centralized ECMO referral model, patients need access to effective, safe critical care transport, but transporting a patient on ECMO carries a significant risk of adverse events.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The purpose of this review is to highlight some of the most common adverse events in ECMO transports and provide management suggestions. Note that these recommendations are not a substitution for close collaboration with medical control, and all adverse events should be promptly reported per organizational protocols.},

	abstract = {Study objective
We use variables from a recently derived acute heart failure risk-stratification rule (STRATIFY) as a basis to develop and optimize risk prediction using additional patient clinical data from electronic health records and machine-learning models.
Methods
Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified all emergency department (ED) visits for acute heart failure between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, among adult health plan members of a large system with 21 EDs. The primary outcome was any 30-day serious adverse event, including death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, balloon-pump insertion, intubation, new dialysis, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Starting with the 13 variables from the STRATIFY rule (base model), we tested whether predictive accuracy in a different population could be enhanced with additional electronic health record–based variables or machine-learning approaches (compared with logistic regression). We calculated our derived model area under the curve (AUC), calculated test characteristics, and assessed admission rates across risk categories.
Results
Among 26,189 total ED encounters, mean patient age was 74 years, 51.7\% were women, and 60.7\% were white. The overall 30-day serious adverse event rate was 18.8\%. The base model had an AUC of 0.76 (95\% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.77). Incorporating additional variables led to improved accuracy with logistic regression (AUC 0.80; 95\% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.82) and machine learning (AUC 0.85; 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.86). We found that 11.1\%, 25.7\%, and 48.9\% of the study population had predicted serious adverse event risk of less than or equal to 3\%, less than or equal to 5\%, and less than or equal to 10\%, respectively, and 28\% of those with less than or equal to 3\% risk were admitted.
Conclusion
Use of a machine-learning model with additional variables improved 30-day risk prediction compared with conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {Background
The “no flow” interval is the time from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Its prognostic value is important to define for prehospital resuscitation decisions, post-resuscitation care and prognostication, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) candidacy assessment.
Methods
We examined bystander-witnessed OHCAs without bystander CPR from two Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium datasets. We used modified Poisson regression to model the relationship between the no-flow interval (9-1-1 call to professional resuscitation) and favourable neurological outcome (Modified Rankin Score ≤ 3) at hospital discharge. Furthermore, we identified the no-flow interval beyond which no patients had a favourable outcome. We analysed a subgroup to simulate ECPR-treated patients (witnessed arrest, age {\textless} 65, non-asystole initial rhythm, and {\textgreater}30 min until return of circulation).
Results
Of 43,593 cases, we included 7299; 616 (8.4\%) had favourable neurological outcomes. Increasing no-flow interval was inversely associated with favourable neurological outcomes (adjusted relative risk 0.87, 95\% CI 0.85–0.90); the adjusted probability of a favourable neurological outcome decreased by 13\% (95\% CI 10–15\%) per minute. No patients (0/7299, 0\%; 1-sided 97.5\% CI 0–0.051\%) had both a no-flow interval {\textgreater}20 min and a favourable neurological outcome. In the hypothetical ECPR group, 0/152 (0\%; 1-sided 97.5\% CI 0–2.4\%) had both a no-flow interval {\textgreater}10 min and a favourable neurological outcome.
Conclusions
The probability of a favourable neurological outcome in OHCA decreases by 13\% for every additional minute of no-flow time until high-quality CPR, with the possibility of favourable outcomes up to 20 min.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has shown promise in the management of cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends and predictors of ECLS utilization and survival to discharge among inpatients with cardiac arrest in the United States.
Methods
All patients admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and those who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) from 2005 to 2014 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample. Patients carrying a pregnancy as well as those with do-not-resuscitate orders or trauma-related diagnoses were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ECLS utilization and survival to discharge.
Results
An estimated 1,624,827 patients were identified. During the study period, use of ECLS increased from 77 to 564 per 100,000 arrests for OHCA, and 60 to 632 per 100,000 arrests for IHCA. Survival among patients on ECLS for OHCA and IHCA increased from 34.2\% to 54.2\% and from 4.7\% to 19.2\%, respectively. Age, year of arrest, cardiac rhythm, and the presence of a potentially reversible etiology including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, were predictive of ECLS utilization. Among patients placed on ECLS, age, rhythm at arrest, and location of arrest were predictive of survival to discharge.
Conclusions
Mortality after cardiac arrest for those on ECLS has substantially decreased. Younger age, shockable rhythm, and out-of-hospital arrest location were predictive of survival or utilization. As ECLS use increases, it is critical to define selection criteria that maximize the benefits of ECLS.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
Existing peer-reviewed literature describing emergency medical technician (EMT) acquisition and transmission of 12-lead electrocardiograms (12L-ECGs), in the absence of a paramedic, is largely limited to feasibility studies.


Study Objective:
The objective of this retrospective observational study was to describe the impact of EMT-acquired 12L-ECGs in Suffolk County, New York (USA), both in terms of the diagnostic quality of the transmitted 12L-ECGs and the number of prehospital percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-center notifications made as a result of transmitted 12L-ECGs demonstrating a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).


Methods:
A pre-existing database was queried for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) calls on which an EMT acquired a 12L-ECG from program initiation (January 2017) through December 31, 2019. Scanned copies of the 12L-ECGs were requested in order to be reviewed by a blinded emergency physician.


Results:
Of the 665 calls, 99 had no 12L-ECG available within the database. For 543 (96\%) of the available 12L-ECGs, the quality was sufficient to diagnose the presence or absence of a STEMI. Eighteen notifications were made to PCI-centers about a concern for STEMI. The median time spent on scene and transporting to the hospital were 18 and 11 minutes, respectively. The median time from PCI-center notification to EMS arrival at the emergency department (ED) was seven minutes (IQR 5-14).


Conclusion:
In the event a cardiac monitor is available, after a limited educational intervention, EMTs are capable of acquiring a diagnostically useful 12L-ECG and transmitting it to a remote medical control physician for interpretation. This allows for prehospital PCI-center activation for a concern of a 12L-ECG with a STEMI, in the event that a paramedic is not available to care for the patient.},

	abstract = {Background:
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has accelerated rapidly for patients in severe cardiac or respiratory failure. As a result, ECMO networks are being developed across the world using a “hub and spoke” model. Current guidelines call for all patients transported on ECMO to be accompanied by a physician during transport. However, as ECMO centers and networks grow, the increasing number of transports will be limited by this mandate.


Objectives:
The aim of this study was to compare rates of adverse events occurring during transport of ECMO patients with and without an additional clinician, defined as a physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician assistant (PA).


Methods:
This is a retrospective cohort study of all adults transported while cannulated on ECMO from 2011-2018 via ground and air between 21 hospitals in the northeastern United States, comparing transports with and without additional clinicians. The primary outcome was the rate of major adverse events, and the secondary outcome was minor adverse events.


Results:
Over the seven-year study period, 93 patients on ECMO were transported. Twenty-three transports (24.7\%) were accompanied by a physician or other additional clinician. Major adverse events occurred in 21.5\% of all transports. There was no difference in the total rate of major adverse events between accompanied and unaccompanied transports (P = .91). Multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any parameter as being predictive of major adverse events.


Conclusions:
In a retrospective cohort study of transports of ECMO patients, there was no association between the overall rate of major adverse events in transport and the accompaniment of an additional clinician. No variables were associated with major adverse events in either cohort.},

The development and application of clinical prediction models using machine learning in clinical decision support systems is attracting increasing attention.

Objective
The aims of this study were to develop a prediction model for cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED) using machine learning and sequential characteristics and to validate its clinical usefulness.

Methods
This retrospective study was conducted with ED patients at a tertiary academic hospital who suffered cardiac arrest. To resolve the class imbalance problem, sampling was performed using propensity score matching. The data set was chronologically allocated to a development cohort (years 2013 to 2016) and a validation cohort (year 2017). We trained three machine learning algorithms with repeated 10-fold cross-validation.

Results
The main performance parameters were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The random forest algorithm (AUROC 0.97; AUPRC 0.86) outperformed the recurrent neural network (AUROC 0.95; AUPRC 0.82) and the logistic regression algorithm (AUROC 0.92; AUPRC=0.72). The performance of the model was maintained over time, with the AUROC remaining at least 80\% across the monitored time points during the 24 hours before event occurrence.

Conclusions
We developed a prediction model of cardiac arrest in the ED using machine learning and sequential characteristics. The model was validated for clinical usefulness by chronological visualization focused on clinical usability.},

	abstract = {Background
 Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are very low and neurologic recovery is poor. Innovative strategies have been developed to improve outcomes. A collaborative extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) program for out-of-hospital refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been developed between The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Columbus Division of Fire. 

Methods
 From August 15, 2017, to June 1, 2019, there were 86 patients that were evaluated in the field for cardiac arrest in which 42 (49\%) had refractory pulseless VT and/or VF resulting from different underlying pathologies and were placed on an automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation device; from these 42 patients, 16 (38\%) met final inclusion criteria for ECPR and were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). 

Results
 From the 16 patients who underwent ECPR, 4 (25\%) survived to hospital discharge with cerebral perfusion category 1 or 2. Survivors tended to be younger (48.0 ± 16.7 vs. 59.3 ± 12.7 years); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.28) likely due to a small number of patients. Overall, 38\% of patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). No significant difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in emergency medical services dispatch to CCL arrival time, lactate in CCL, coronary artery disease severity, undergoing PCI, and pre-ECMO PaO2, pH, and hemoglobin. Recovery was seen in different underlying pathologies. 

Conclusion
 ECPR for out-of-hospital refractory VT/VF cardiac arrest demonstrated encouraging outcomes. Younger patients may have a greater chance of survival, perhaps the need to be more aggressive in this subgroup of patients.},

Besides, the morphology of upsloping or nonupsloping ST depression (STD) may have different significance of severity and prognostication. Methods We searched the MEDLINE database using “de Winter” or “junctional ST-depression with tall symmetrical T-waves” or “tall T wave” or “STEMI equivalent” as the item up to March 2020. We compared the ECG differences between the different culprit arteries and various morphological STD. Results A total of 70 patients with analyzable ECGs were included. In 60 patients (LAD group), the LAD was the culprit artery, while in 10 patients (non-LAD group), there were other etiologies. Maximal STD in V2 or V3 had a PPV of 89\% of all patients and 98\% of patients without ST elevation in V2 to detect an acute LAD lesion. The presence of q/Q-wave or poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads was significantly more often found in patients with upsloping STD than in patients with nonupsloping STD in the LAD group (84\% vs. 27\%, p {\textless} .01). In 18 patients, the ECG showed a change from upsloping to nonupsloping STD from the leads with maximal STD to the surrounding leads with less STD. Conclusions The location of the maximal STD in the precordial leads differs between patients with LAD as the culprit artery and other etiologies of the de Winter ECG pattern. Upsloping STD signifies more severe signs of ischemia than nonupsloping STD.},

	abstract = {Objective: The management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is time-critical, with a focus on early reperfusion to decrease morbidity and mortality. It is imperative that prehospital clinicians recognize STEMI early and initiate transport to hospitals capable of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a door-to-balloon time of ≤90 minutes. Three patterns have been identified as STEMI equivalents that also likely warrant prompt attention and potentially PCI: Wellens syndrome, De Winter T waves, and aVR ST elevation. The goal of our study was to assess the incidence of these findings in prehospital patients presenting with chest pain. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review from a large urban tertiary care emergency department. We reviewed the prehospital ECG, or ECG upon arrival, of 861 patients who were hospitalized and required cardiac catheterization between 4/10/18 and 5/7/19. Patients who had field catheterization lab activation by EMS for STEMI were excluded. If a prehospital ECG was not available for review, the first ECG obtained in the hospital was used as a proxy. Each ECG was screened for aVR elevation, De Winter T waves, and Wellens syndrome. Results: Of 278 charts with prehospital ECGs available, 12 met our criteria for STEMI equivalency (4.4\%): 6 Wellens syndrome and 6 aVR STEMI. There were no cases of De Winters T waves. Of 573 charts with no prehospital ECG available, 27 had initial hospital ECGs that met our STEMI equivalent criteria (4.7\%): 7 Wellens syndrome and 20 aVR STEMI. Again, there were no cases of De Winters T waves. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that there are significant numbers of patients whose prehospital ECG findings do not currently meet criteria for field activation of the cardiac catheterization lab, but who may require prompt catheterization. Further studies are needed to look at outcomes, but these results could support the need for further education of prehospital clinicians regarding recognition of these STEMI equivalents, as well as quality initiatives aimed at decreasing door-to-balloon time for patients with STEMI equivalents.},

The study describes the implementation of a prehospital treatment algorithm that included intravenous (IV) bolus (IVB) nitroglycerin (NTG) followed by maintenance infusion for the treatment of acute pulmonary edema (APE) in a single, high-volume Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system.


Methods:
This is a retrospective chart review of patients who received IVB NTG for APE in a large EMS system in Minnesota and Wisconsin (USA). Inclusion criteria for treatment included a diagnosis of APE, systolic blood pressure ≥120mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93\% following 800mcg of sublingual NTG. Patients received a 400mcg IVB of NTG, repeated every two minutes as needed, and subsequent infusion at 80mcg/min for transport times ≥10 minutes.


Results:
Forty-four patients were treated with IVB NTG. The median total bolus dose was 400mcg. Twenty patients were treated with NTG infusion following IVB NTG. The median infusion rate was 80mcg/min. For all patients, the initial median blood pressure was 191/113mmHg. Five minutes following IVB NTG, it was 160/94mmHg, and on arrival to the emergency department (ED) it was 152/90mmHg. Five minutes after the initial dose of IVB NTG, median SpO2 increased to 92\% from an initial reading of 88\% and was 94\% at hospital arrival. One episode of transient hypotension occurred during EMS transport.


Conclusion:
Patients treated with IVB NTG for APE had reduction in blood pressure and improvement in SpO2 compared to their original presentation. Prehospital treatment of APE with IVB appears to be feasible and safe. A randomized trial is needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The necessity of rapid preload and afterload reduction in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute pulmonary edema (APE) is well established. In the hospital setting, intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin demonstrates improved patient morbidity and mortality. However, prehospital treatment is typically limited to sublingual nitroglycerin at doses that often do not affect afterload. In this study, we assessed feasibility, safety and effectiveness of prehospital IV bolus nitroglycerin in decompensated CHF patients with APE. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of all emergency medical services (EMS) and ED patient care records of subjects treated for presumed decompensated CHF with APE with bolus-dose IV nitroglycerin between March 15, 2018 and March 15, 2019 by a large, suburban, county-based EMS service in Texas. Inclusion criteria for treatment included both hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] {\textgreater} 160 mmHg) and acute respiratory distress with a paramedic clinical impression of decompensated CHF with APE. Treatment consisted of a 1 mg nitroglycerin bolus, repeated in 5 minutes if SBP {\textgreater} 160 mmHg. Results: During the study period, 48 patients were treated with IV bolus nitroglycerin. Initially, the median (IQR) SBP was 211.0 mmHg (190.0–229.5), 5-minutes post IV NTG was 177.0 mmHg (155.0–199.0), and upon ED arrival was 181.5 mmHg (157.0–207.0). 5 minutes after IV nitroglycerin, the median pulse decreased from 113 (96–124) to 103 (85–117) beats per minute and the median oxygen saturation increased from 86\% (74–89) to 98\% (96–99). Based on hospital records review, 45/48 (94\%) of patients treated with IV nitroglycerin were found to have CHF with APE. A single episode of transient hypotension, which resolved without treatment, did occur during EMS transport. Conclusion: This case series found that patients who were treated by paramedics with IV NTG had improved systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation upon ED arrival as compared to their initial presentation. Over 90\% of these patients were correctly identified by paramedics as having CHF with APE based on ED evaluation. Only one patient had an adverse event, which was transient hypotension that did not require intervention.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The number of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is increasing each year. Despite a lack of evidence, many emergency medical systems and hospitals have recommended against performing chest compressions in these patients. This deviation from conventional resuscitation algorithms is secondary to concern that chest compressions could dislodge the LVAD.
Objective
To assess whether cannula dislodgment occurred in LVAD patients receiving chest compressions.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of all LVAD patients who received chest compressions for cardiac arrest over a four year period in a large urban hospital. Eight cases were reviewed for both cannula integrity and outcomes.
Results
Using autopsy and adequate flow through device as proxy for intact inflow/outflow cannulas, none of the eight patients receiving chest compressions had cannula dislodgment. Four of the 8 patients had return of neurologic function.
Conclusions
In this small retrospective case series, standard chest compressions in patients with LVADs did not cause cannula dislodgment. More research is necessary to determine the utility of chest compressions in the LVAD population.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used to improve longevity in patients with advanced heart failure; however, optimal management of end-of-life issues including cardiopulmonary arrest remains uncertain for this relatively new population. We aim to assess the safety and efficacy of Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ALCS) including chest compressions in patients with LVADs.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of all LVAD patients that received ACLS and chest compressions for in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest at a single academic medical center between 2011 and 2017. We evaluated post-arrest survival, LVAD parameters/function, imaging studies, and autopsy results to assess for (1) structural issues such as LVAD dislodgment, aortic dissection/rupture, or pericardial effusion, and (2) LVAD mechanical issues such as hardware or software failure.
Results
Durable LVADs were implanted in 191 patients during the study period, of which 18 patients (9\%) suffered in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest necessitating ACLS (median of 22.5 days, range from 1 to 1323 days from implant). Of the patients requiring ACLS 11 (61\%) survived the arrest with 7 (39\%) surviving to hospital discharge. Ten patients (56\%) received manual external chest compressions, and 7 (39\%) received defibrillator shocks. Of the patients who received chest compressions and/or defibrillator shocks, no significant changes to LVAD parameters/function was noted after the arrest. Five autopsies were completed, all of which reported the LVAD in its proper position without evidence structural or mechanical LVAD complications. Two of the surviving patients were taken emergently to the operating room for treatment of cardiac tamponade; during the procedure the LVAD anastomoses were inspected, and no bleeding was noted in either case. Two echocardiograms were performed following chest compressions without evidence of LVAD dysfunction. There were no iatrogenic sequelae identified in any of the patients following ACLS.
Conclusion
While cardiopulmonary arrest in patients with LVADs is associated with high mortality, ACLS with chest compressions appears to be safe. Larger studies are warranted to identify patterns of post ALCS complications and define potential population-specific management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identiﬁcation of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is critical because early reperfusion can save myocardium and increase survival. ST elevation (STE) in lead augmented vector right (aVR), coexistent with multilead ST depression, was endorsed as a sign of acute occlusion of the left main or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery in the 2013 STEMI guidelines. We investigated the incidence of an acutely occluded coronary in patients presenting with STE-aVR with multilead ST depression.
METHODS: STEMI activations between January 2014 and April 2018 at the University of Arizona Medical Center were identiﬁed. All electrocardiograms (ECGs) and coronary angiograms were blindly analyzed by experienced cardiologists. Among 847 STEMI activations, 99 patients (12\%) were identiﬁed with STEaVR with multilead ST depression.
RESULTS: Emergent angiography was performed in 80\% (79/99) of patients. Thirty-six patients (36\%) presented with cardiac arrest, and 78\% (28/36) underwent emergent angiography. Coronary occlusion, thought to be culprit, was identiﬁed in only 8 patients (10\%), and none of those lesions were left main or left anterior descending occlusions. A total of 47 patients (59\%) were found to have severe coronary disease, but most had intact distal ﬂow. Thirty-two patients (40\%) had mild to moderate or no signiﬁcant disease. However, STE-aVR with multilead ST depression was associated with 31\% in-hospital mortality compared with only 6.2\% in a subgroup of 190 patients with STEMI without STE-aVR (p{\textless}0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: STE-aVR with multilead ST depression was associated with acutely thrombotic coronary occlusion in only 10\% of patients. Routine STEMI activation in STE-aVR for emergent revascularization is not warranted, although urgent, rather than emergent, catheterization appears to be important.},

Various cases are presented to highlight the different causes of the tall RV1. (Am J Emerg Med 2001;19: 504-513. Copyright © 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company)},

	abstract = {Background
The current ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) vs. non-STEMI (NSTEMI) paradigm prevents some NSTEMI patients with acute coronary occlusion from receiving emergent reperfusion, in spite of their known increased mortality compared with NSTEMI without occlusion. We have proposed a new paradigm known as occlusion MI vs. nonocclusion MI (OMI vs. NOMI).
Objective
We aimed to compare the two paradigms within a single population. We hypothesized that STEMI(–) OMI would have characteristics similar to STEMI(+) OMI but longer time to catheterization.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected acute coronary syndrome population. OMI was defined as an acute culprit and either TIMI 0–2 flow or TIMI 3 flow plus peak troponin T {\textgreater} 1.0 ng/mL. We collected electrocardiograms, demographic characteristics, laboratory results, angiographic data, and outcomes.
Results
Among 467 patients, there were 108 OMIs, with only 60\% (67 of 108) meeting STEMI criteria. Median peak troponin T for the STEMI(+) OMI, STEMI(–) OMI, and no occlusion groups were 3.78 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.18–7.63), 1.87 (IQR 1.12–5.48), and 0.00 (IQR 0.00–0.08). Median time from arrival to catheterization was 41 min (IQR 23–86 min) for STEMI(+) OMI compared with 437 min (IQR 85–1590 min) for STEMI(–) OMI (p {\textless} 0.001). STEMI(+) OMI was more likely than STEMI(–) OMI to undergo catheterization within 90 min (76\% vs. 28\%; p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
STEMI(–) OMI patients had significant delays to catheterization but adverse outcomes more similar to STEMI(+) OMI than those with no occlusion. These data support the OMI/NOMI paradigm and the importance of further research into emergent reperfusion for STEMI(–) OMI.},

Patients were randomly assigned to early ECMO-facilitated resuscitation or standard ACLS treatment on hospital arrival by use of a secure schedule generated with permuted blocks of randomly varying block sizes. Allocation concealment was achieved by use of a randomisation schedule that required scratching off an opaque layer to reveal assignment. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were safety, survival, and functional assessment at hospital discharge and at 3 months and 6 months after discharge. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis.

	abstract = {Objectives
Reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is indicated in the presence of ST elevation (STE) and ischemic symptoms. Previous MI may present with persistent STE or “left ventricular aneurysm” (LVA) morphology that mimics AMI.
Hypothesis
A high ratio of T amplitude to QRS amplitude best distinguishes AMI from LVA.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort analysis. Patients with anatomical LVA by echocardiography were identified and those who presented to the ED with ischemic symptoms and STE of at least 1 mm in 2 consecutive leads and ruled out for acute left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion were selected. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were compared with a control group of 37 consecutive anterior AMI (aAMI) with proven acute LAD occlusion. Bundle-branch block was excluded. Various ECG measurements and ratios were compared.
Results
Twenty patients with LVA met the inclusion criteria. The best discriminator was T amplitude sum to QRS amplitude sum ratio V1-V4, misclassifying only 4 (6.8\%) of 59 cases at a cutoff of {\textgreater}0.22 for AMI. For aAMI and LVA, respectively, mean (±95\% CI) ratio of the sum of T amplitudes in V1 to V4 to the sum of QRS amplitude in V1-V4 was 0.54 ± 0.085 and 0.16 ± 0.021 (P {\textless} .00012). Thirty-five of 37 aAMI had a ratio {\textgreater}0.22; the false negatives (ratio {\textless}0.22) had 11.5 and 6 hours of symptoms before the ECG. Twenty of 22 LVA had a ratio ≤0.22. Mean highest T/QRS ratio in V1-V4 was 1.1 ± 0.29 for an AMI and 0.26 ± 0.056 for LVA (P {\textless} 10-7).
Conclusion
T amplitude/QRS amplitude ratio best distinguishes aAMI from LVA in ECGs that meet STE criteria for reperfusion therapy. A high ratio is associated with an AMI.},

An assessment of the methods of medical record review studies published in emergency medicine journals during a 5-year period ending in 1993 provided strategies for improvements. We assess and quantify the current methodologic quality of medical record review studies in emergency medicine journals using published guidelines and compare these results among journals and with those of 10 years previously.
Methods
Independent, systematic searches of emergency medicine journals identified all medical record review studies published in 2003. Methodology assessments of each selected study were conducted independently by 2 other researchers, and disagreements were resolved by arbitration.
Results
We identified 79 (14\%) medical record review studies in 563 original research articles in 6 emergency medicine journals. The highest adherence to methodologic standards was found for sampling method (99\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 93\% to 100\%), and the lowest was for abstractor blinding to hypothesis (4\%; 95\% CI 1\% to 11\%). Interobserver agreement for the 12 criteria ranged from 57\% to 95\%. A comparison of these results with those of 10 years ago revealed significant improvements in 3 of the 8 original criteria assessed: data abstraction forms, mentioning interobserver performance, and testing interobserver performance.
Conclusion
Medical record review studies continue to comprise a substantial proportion of original research in the emergency medicine literature. Important improvements are noted in some criteria, but adherence remains below 50\% for 7 of the 12 criteria assessed.},

Pre‐2015 patients formed the derivation cohort (n=163, 61 with AMI); patients between 2015 and 2018 formed the validation cohort (n=107, 40 with AMI). A control group of patients without suspected AMI was also studied (n=214). Different electrocardiographic criteria were tested. A total of 484 patients were studied. A new electrocardiographic algorithm (BARCELONA algorithm) was derived and validated. The algorithm is positive in the presence of ST deviation ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) concordant with QRS polarity, in any lead, or ST deviation ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) discordant with the QRS, in leads with max (R{\textbar}S) voltage (the voltage of the largest deflection of the QRS, ie, R or S wave) ≤6 mm (0.6 mV). In both the derivation and the validation cohort, the BARCELONA algorithm achieved the highest sensitivity (93\%–95\%), negative predictive value (96\%–97\%), efficiency (91\%–94\%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.92–0.93), significantly higher than previous electrocardiographic rules (P{\textless}0.01); the specificity was good in both groups (89\%–94\%) as well as the control group (90\%).ConclusionsIn patients with left bundle branch block referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, the BARCELONA algorithm was specific and highly sensitive for the diagnosis of AMI, leading to a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that obtained by ECG in patients without left bundle branch block.},

Objective: To determine whether tranexamic acid treatment initiated in the out-of-hospital setting within 2 hours of injury improves neurologic outcome in patients with moderate or severe TBI.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial at 20 trauma centers and 39 emergency medical services agencies in the US and Canada from May 2015 to November 2017. Eligible participants (N = 1280) included out-of-hospital patients with TBI aged 15 years or older with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less and systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.
Interventions: Three interventions were evaluated, with treatment initiated within 2 hours of TBI: out-of-hospital tranexamic acid (1 g) bolus and in-hospital tranexamic acid (1 g) 8-hour infusion (bolus maintenance group; n = 312), out-of-hospital tranexamic acid (2 g) bolus and in-hospital placebo 8-hour infusion (bolus only group; n = 345), and out-of-hospital placebo bolus and in-hospital placebo 8-hour infusion (placebo group; n = 309).
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was favorable neurologic function at 6 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score {\textgreater}4 [moderate disability or good recovery]) in the combined tranexamic acid group vs the placebo group. Asymmetric significance thresholds were set at 0.1 for benefit and 0.025 for harm. There were 18 secondary end points, of which 5 are reported in this article: 28-day mortality, 6-month Disability Rating Scale score (range, 0 [no disability] to 30 [death]), progression of intracranial hemorrhage, incidence of seizures, and incidence of thromboembolic events.
Results: Among 1063 participants, a study drug was not administered to 96 randomized participants and 1 participant was excluded, resulting in 966 participants in the analysis population (mean age, 42 years; 255 [74\%] male participants; mean Glasgow Coma Scale score, 8). Of these participants, 819 (84.8\%) were available for primary outcome analysis at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 65\% of patients in the tranexamic acid groups vs 62\% in the placebo group (difference, 3.5\%; [90\% 1-sided confidence limit for benefit, -0.9\%]; P = .16; [97.5\% 1-sided confidence limit for harm, 10.2\%]; P = .84). There was no statistically significant difference in 28-day mortality between the tranexamic acid groups vs the placebo group (14\% vs 17\%; difference, -2.9\% [95\% CI, -7.9\% to 2.1\%]; P = .26), 6-month Disability Rating Scale score (6.8 vs 7.6; difference, -0.9 [95\% CI, -2.5 to 0.7]; P = .29), or progression of intracranial hemorrhage (16\% vs 20\%; difference, -5.4\% [95\% CI, -12.8\% to 2.1\%]; P = .16).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate to severe TBI, out-of-hospital tranexamic acid administration within 2 hours of injury compared with placebo did not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.

	abstract = {Objective
Optimal management of out of hospital circulatory arrest (OHCA) remains challenging, in particular in patients who do not develop rapid return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) can be a life-saving bridging procedure. However its requirements and feasibility of implementation in patients with OHCA, appropriate inclusion criteria and achievable outcomes remain poorly defined.

Design
Prospective cohort study.

Setting
Tertiary referral university hospital center.

Patients
Here we report on characteristics, course and outcomes on the first consecutive 254 patients admitted between August 2014 and December 2017.

Intervention
eCPR program for OHCA.

Mesurements and main results
A structured clinical pathway was designed and implemented as 24/7 eCPR service at the Charité in Berlin. In total, 254 patients were transferred with ongoing CPR, including automated chest compression, of which 30 showed or developed ROSC after admission. Following hospital admission predefined in- and exclusion criteria for eCPR were checked; in the remaining 224, 126 were considered as eligible for eCPR., State of the art postresuscitation therapy was applied and prognostication of neurological outcome was performed according to a standardized protocol., Eighteen patients survived, with a good neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2) in 15 patients. Compared to non-survivors survivors had significantly shorter time between collaps and start of eCPR (58 min (IQR 12–85) vs. 90 min (IQR 74–114), p = 0.01), lower lactate levels on admission (95 mg/dL (IQR 44–130) vs. 143 mg/dL (IQR 111–178), p {\textless}  0.05), and less severe acidosis on admission (pH 7.2 (IQR 7.15–7.4) vs. 7.0 (IQR6.9–7.2), p {\textless}  0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis identified latency to eCPR and low pH as independent predictors for mortality.

Conclusion
An eCPR program can be life-saving for a subset of individuals with refractory circulatory arrest, with time to initiation of eCPR being a main determinant of survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) refractory to conventional high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be rescued by extracorporeal CPR (eCPR) using veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Even when trying to identify eCPR candidates based on criteria assumed to be associated with a favourable neurological outcome, reported survival rates are frequently below 10\%.
METHODS: All patients undergoing implantation of V-A ECMO for eCPR between January 2018 and December 2019 (N = 40) were analysed (age 53±13 years; 75\% male). Patients with refractory OHCA and potentially favourable circumstances (initial shockable rhythm, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, absence of limiting comorbidities, age {\textless}75 years) were transported under mechanical chest compression. Candidates for eCPR should have a pH ≥6.9, arterial lactate ≤15 mmol/L and time-to-ECMO should be ≤60 minutes.
RESULTS: Overall 30-day survival was 12.5\%, with 3 of 5 survivors having a favourable neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2), representing 7.5\% of the total eCPR population. No patient selected for eCPR met all pre-defined criteria (median of unfavourable criteria: 3). Importantly, time-to-ECMO most often (39/40) exceeded 60 minutes (mean 102 ±32 min.), and lactate was {\textgreater}15mmol/L in 30 out of 40 patients. Moreover, 22 out of 40 patients had a non-shockable rhythm on the first ECG.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite our intention to select patients with potentially advantageous circumstances to achieve acceptable eCPR outcomes, the imminent deadly consequence of withholding eCPR obviously prompted individual physicians to perform the procedure also in presumably more unfavourable settings, resulting in similar mortality rates of eCPR as reported before.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ajem.2019.04.036},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although there is no consensus on how to use an electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with hyperkalemia, physicians often obtain it in the acute setting when diagnosing and treating hyperkalemia. The objective of this study is to evaluate if physicians are able to detect hyperkalemia based on the ECG.
METHODS: The study was conducted at a large county hospital with a population of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who received hemodialysis (HD) solely on an emergent basis. Five hundred twenty eight ECGs from ESRD patients were evaluated. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was approximately 60\% in this cohort, with at least half of them in the severe hyperkalemia range (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L).
RESULTS: The mean sensitivity and specificity of the emergency physicians detecting hyperkalemia were 0.19 (± 0.16) and 0.97(± 0.04) respectively. The mean positive predictive value of evaluators for detecting hyperkalemia was 0.92 (±0.13) and the mean negative predictive value was 0.46 (± 0.05). In severe hyperkalemia (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L), the mean sensitivity improved to 0.29 (± 0.20), while specificity decreased to 0.95 (±0.07).
CONCLUSION: An ECG is not a sensitive method of detecting hyperkalemia and should not be relied upon to rule it out. However, the ECG has a high specificity for detecting hyperkalemia and could be used as a rule in test.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In periarrest situations and during resuscitation it is essential to rule out reversible causes. Hyperkalemia is one of the most common, reversible causes of periarrest situations. Typical electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations may indicate hyperkalemia. The aim of our study was to compare the prevalence of ECG alterations suggestive of hyperkalemia in normokalemic and hyperkalemic patients.
METHODS: 170 patients with normal potassium (K+) levels and 135 patients with moderate (serum K+ = 6.0-7.0 mmol/l) or severe (K+ {\textgreater} 7.0 mmol/l) hyperkalemia, admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Somogy County Kaposi Mór General Hospital, were selected for this retrospective, cross-sectional study. ECG obtained upon admission were analyzed by two emergency physicians, independently, blinded to the objectives of the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS22 software. χ2 test and Fischer exact tests were applied.
RESULTS: 24\% of normokalemic patients and 46\% of patients with elevated potassium levels had some kind of ECG alteration suggestive of hyperkalemia. Wide QRS (31.6\%), peaked T-waves (18.4\%), Ist degree AV-block (18.4\%) and bradycardia (18.4\%) were the most common and significantly more frequent ECG alterations suggestive of hyperkalemia in severely hyperkalemic patients compared with normokalemic patients (8.2, 4.7, 7.1 and 6.5\%, respectively). There was no significant difference between the frequency of ECG alterations suggestive of hyperkalemia in normokalemic and moderately hyperkalemic patients. Upon examining ECG alterations not typically associated with hyperkalemia, we found that prolonged QTc was the only ECG alteration which was significantly more prevalent in both patients with moderate (17.5\%) and severe hyperkalemia (21.1\%) compared to patients with normokalemia (5.3\%).
CONCLUSIONS: A minority of patients with normal potassium levels may also exhibit ECG alterations considered to be suggestive of hyperkalemia, while more than half of the patients with hyperkalemia do not have ECG alterations suggesting hyperkalemia. These results imply that treatment of hyperkalemia in the prehospital setting should be initiated with caution. Multiple ECG alterations, however, should draw attention to potentially life threatening conditions.},

DESIGN: ECGs of patients at high risk for hyperkalemia were interpreted retrospectively by two physicians blinded not only to the specific clinical diagnosis of the patient and to their serum potassium measurement but also to each other's interpretation. The physicians predicted the presence or absence of hyperkalemia as well as the severity of hyperkalemia on a nominal scale (mild, moderate, or severe). SETTING: The emergency department of a university-affiliated urban county hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty consecutive patients admitted to the hospital from the ED with a diagnosis of renal failure or hyperkalemia. Eighty-seven patients had hyperkalemia, and 133 did not. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the readers for predicting hyperkalemia were .43 and .34, respectively (best positive predictive value, .65). The respective specificities for detecting hyperkalemia were .85 and .86 (best negative predictive value, .69). When only patients with moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia (potassium of more than 6.5 mmol/L) were analyzed, sensitivities were .62 and .55. The readers' ability to predict the severity of hyperkalemia was equally poor. CONCLUSION: The ECG is not a sensitive method of detecting hyperkalemia, even in high-risk patients. The specificity of the ECG is better for hyperkalemia, but empiric treatment of hyperkalemia based on the ECG alone will lead to mistreatment of at least 15\% of patients.},

Case reports suggest patients with renal insufficiency may have no electrocardiographic changes despite markedly elevated serum potassium. In a prospective series, 46\% of patients with hyperkalemia were noted to have electrocardiographic changes, but no clear criteria were presented. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: Charts were reviewed for patients who were admitted to a community-based hospital with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Inclusion criteria were potassium [\&ge;]6 with a concurrent electrocardiogram. Data were abstracted regarding comorbid diagnoses, medications, and treatment. Potassium concentrations were documented along with other electrolytes, pH, creatinine, and biomarkers of cardiac injury. Coincident, baseline, and follow-up electrocardiograms were examined for quantitative and qualitative changes in the QRS and T waves as well as the official cardiology readings. Results: Ninety patients met criteria; two thirds were older than 65, and 48\% presented with renal failure. Common medications included \{beta\} blockers, insulin, and aspirin; 80\% had potassium {\textless}7.2. The electrocardiogram was insensitive for diagnosing hyperkalemia. Quantitative assessments of T-wave amplitude corroborated subjective assessments of T-wave peaking; however, no diagnostic threshold could be established. The probability of electrocardiographic changes increased with increasing potassium. The correlation between readers was moderate. Conclusions: Given the poor sensitivity and specificity of electrocardiogram changes, there is no support for their use in guiding treatment of stable patients. Without identifiable electrocardiographic markers of the risk for complications, management of hyperkalemia should be guided by the clinical scenario and serial potassium measurements.},

	abstract = {Study objective
Acute pulmonary embolism can produce abnormalities on ECG that reflect severity of pulmonary hypertension. Early recognition of these findings may alter the estimated pretest probability of pulmonary embolism and prompt more aggressive treatment before hemodynamic instability ensues, but it is first important to test whether these findings are specific to patients with pulmonary embolism. We hypothesize that ECG findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension would be observed more frequently in patients with pulmonary embolism.
Methods
Secondary analysis of a prospective, observational cohort of emergency department patients who were tested for pulmonary embolism. ECGs were ordered at clinician's discretion and interpreted at presentation.
Results
Six thousand forty-nine patients had an ECG, 354 (5.9\%) of whom were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The frequency, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of each predictor were as follows: S1Q3T3 8.5\% with pulmonary embolism versus 3.3\% without pulmonary embolism (LR+ 3.7; 95\% CI 2.5 to 5.4); nonsinus rhythm, 23.5\% versus 16.6\% (LR+ 1.4; 95\% CI 1.2 to 1.7); inverted T waves in V1 to V2, 14.4\% versus 8.1\% (LR+ 1.8; 95\% CI 1.3 to 2.3); inversion in V1 to V3, 10.5\% versus 4.0\% (LR+ 2.6; 95\% CI 1.9 to 3.6); inversion in V1 to V4, 7.3\% versus 2.0\% (LR+ 3.7; 95\% CI 2.4 to 5.5); incomplete right bundle branch block, 4.8\% versus 2.8\% (LR+ 1.7; 95\% CI 1.0 to 2.7); tachycardia (pulse rate {\textgreater}100 beats/min), 28.8\% versus 15.7\% (LR+ 1.8; 95\% CI 1.5 to 2.2). Likelihood ratios and specificities were similar when patients with previous cardiopulmonary disease were excluded from analysis.
Conclusion
Findings of acute pulmonary hypertension were infrequent overall but were observed more frequently in patients with the final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism compared with patients who do not have pulmonary embolism.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To establish the diagnostic value of prespecified ECG changes in suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).
METHODS: Retrospective case-control study in a district general hospital setting. We identified 189 consecutive patients with suspected PE whose CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was positive for a first PE and for whom an ECG taken at the time of presentation was available. We matched these for age±3 years with 189 controls with suspected PE whose CTPA was negative. We considered those with large (n=76) and small (n=113) clot load separately. We scored each ECG for the presence or absence of eight features that have been reported to occur more commonly in PE.
RESULTS: 20\%-25\% of patients with PE, including those with large clot load, had normal ECGs. The most common ECG abnormality in patients with PE was sinus tachycardia (28\%). S1Q3T3 (3.7\%), P pulmonale (0.5\%) and right axis deviation (4.2\%) were infrequent findings. Right bundle branch block (9.0\%), atrial dysrhythmias (10.1\%) and clockwise rotation (20.1\%) occurred more frequently but were also common in controls. Right ventricular (RV) strain pattern was significantly more commonly in patients than controls, 11.1\% vs 2.6\% (sensitivity 11.1\%, specificity 97.4\%; OR 4.58, 95\% CI 1.63 to 15.91; p=0.002), particularly in those with large clot load, 17.1\% vs 2.6\% (sensitivity 17.1\%, specificity 97.4\%; OR 7.55, 95\% CI 1.62 to 71.58; p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: An ECG showing RV strain in a breathless patient is highly suggestive of PE. Many of the other ECG changes that have been described in PE occur too infrequently to be of predictive value.},

Here, we report the first P-ECMO procedure in North America for refractory ventricular fibrillation involving a 65-year-old male patient who was cannulated in the field within the recommended 60-minute low-flow window and transported to our institution where he underwent coronary stenting.

	abstract = {Background
Although ST-segment elevation (STE) has been used synonymously with acute coronary occlusion (ACO), current STE criteria miss nearly one-third of ACO and result in a substantial amount of false catheterization laboratory activations. As many other electrocardiographic (ECG) findings can reliably indicate ACO, we sought whether a new ACO/non-ACO myocardial infarction (MI) paradigm would result in better identification of the patients who need acute reperfusion therapy.
Methods
A total of 3000 patients were enrolled in STEMI, non-STEMI and control groups. All ECGs were reviewed by two cardiologists, blinded to any outcomes, for the current STEMI criteria and other subtle signs. A combined ACO endpoint was composed of peak troponin level, troponin rise within the first 24 h and angiographic appearance. The dead or alive status was checked from hospital records and from the electronic national database.
Results
In non-STEMI group, 28.2\% of the patients were re-classified by the ECG reviewers as having ACO. This subgroup had a higher frequency of ACO, myocardial damage, and both in-hospital and long-term mortality compared to non-STEMI group. A prospective ACOMI/non-ACOMI approach to the ECG had superior diagnostic accuracy compared to the STE/non-STEMI approach in the prediction of ACO and long-term mortality. In Cox-regression analysis early intervention in patients with non-ACO-predicting ECGs was associated with a higher long-term mortality.
Conclusions
We believe that it is time for a new paradigm shift from the STEMI/non-STEMI to the ACOMI/non-ACOMI in the acute management of MI. (DIFOCCULT study; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04022668.)},

	abstract = {Industry predictions focus on future e-hospitals that will integrate all stakeholders into a seamless network, allowing data to be shared. The Health Level Seven (HL7) is a standard for the interchange of data within the healthcare industry. It simplifies communication interfaces and allows the interoperability among heterogeneous applications. Although the benefits of adopting HL7 are well known, only a few hospitals in Taiwan have actually adopted it. What are the reasons behind the hospitals’ lack of intention to adopt HL7? Most prior studies on HL7 have focused on technical issues and general overlooked the managerial side. This has caused a lack of understanding of factors influencing hospitals’ decision on HL7 adoption. In fact, main reasons behind a hospital’s decision on whether to adopt an innovative technology are more often related to organizational than purely technical issues. Hence, we pay our attention to these organizational considerations over HL7 adoption. Based on the Innovation Diffusion Theory, we proposed a research model to explore the critical factors influencing Taiwan hospitals’ adoption intention of HL7. 472 questionnaires were distributed to all accredited hospitals in Taiwan and 122 were returned. The valid response rate was 25.21\% (119). Factor analysis, logistic regression and Pearson Chi-square test were conducted to verify the research model. The results showed that environmental pressure, top management attitude towards HL7, staff’s technology capability, system integrity, and hospital’s scale were critical factors influencing hospitals’ intention on whether to adopt HL7. The research findings provided the government, the healthcare industry, the hospital administrators and the academia with practical and theoretical references. These factors should be considered in planning promotion plan to encourage hospital adoption of HL7. This study also opens up a new research direction as well as a new viewpoint, and consequentially improves the completeness of related researches in the medical informatics discipline.},

	abstract = {Objective: While widely used in the treatment of cardiac conditions, only limited data characterize out-of-hospital nitroglycerin (NTG) use. We sought to determine the safety of out-of-hospital sublingual NTG administered for suspected ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and its effect on the patient's pain score. Methods: We prospectively identified adult patients with suspected STEMI transported by paramedics to three percutaneous Coronary Intervention PCI-capable hospitals in a large urban-suburban emergency medical services (EMS) system. We compared patients who received field NTG to those who did not. The primary outcome was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between initial EMS measurement and emergency department (ED) triage vital signs. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of hypotension (SBP {\textless} 100 mmHg) and bradycardia (HR {\textless} 60) on ED arrival, drop in SBP ≥ 30 mmHg, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and the change in pain score compared to an a priori threshold of −1.39. Results: Among 940 EMS transports for suspected STEMI, we excluded 160 for initial SBP {\textless} 100 mmHg, leaving 780 subjects for the analysis. Median age was 67 with 61\% male. NTG was administered to 340 (44\%) patients. The median change in SBP was −10 mmHg (IQR −27, 2) and −3 mmHg (IQR −20, 9) in patients treated with and without NTG, respectively. The median difference in the decrease in SBP was 6 mmHg (95\% CI 3, 9 mmHg). The frequencies of ED hypotension and bradycardia, the drop in SBP ≥ 30 mmHg, and the OHCA did not differ between groups. For patients with an initial pain score {\textgreater} 0, the average change in pain score for patients treated with NTG was −2.6 (95\% CI −3.0, −2.2), while patients who did not receive NTG had a change in pain score of −1.4 (95\% CI −1.8, −1.0). Conclusion: In this cohort, field NTG did not result in a clinically significant decrease in blood pressure when compared with patients who did not receive NTG. However, NTG did cause a clinically significant reduction in pain.},

	abstract = {Patients with inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), associated with right ventricular infarction, are thought to be at higher risk of developing hypotension when administered nitroglycerin (NTG). However, current basic life support (BLS) protocols do not differentiate location of STEMI prior to NTG administration. We sought to determine if NTG administration is more likely to be associated with hypotension (systolic blood pressure {\textless} 90 mmHg) in inferior STEMI compared to non-inferior STEMI. We conducted a retrospective chart review of prehospital patients with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin and computer-interpreted prehospital ECGs indicating "ACUTE MI." We included all local STEMI cases identified as part of our STEMI registry. Univariate analysis was used to compare differences in proportions of hypotension and drop in systolic blood pressure ≥ 30 mmHg after nitroglycerin administration between patients with inferior wall STEMI and those with STEMI in another region (non-inferior). Multiple variable logistic regression analysis was also used to assess the study outcomes while controlling for various factors. Over a 29-month period, we identified 1,466 STEMI cases. Of those, 821 (56.0\%) received NTG. We excluded 16 cases because of missing data. Hypotension occurred post NTG in 38/466 inferior STEMIs and 30/339 non-inferior STEMIs, 8.2\% vs. 8.9\%, p = 0.73. A drop in systolic blood pressure ≥ 30 mmHg post NTG occurred in 23.4\% of inferior STEMIs and 23.9\% of non-inferior STEMIs, p = 0.87. Interrater agreement for chart review of the primary outcome was excellent (κ = 0.94). NTG administration to patients with chest pain and inferior STEMI on their computer-interpreted electrocardiogram is not associated with a higher rate of hypotension compared to patients with STEMI in other territories. Computer interpretation of inferior STEMI cannot be used as the sole predictor for patients who may be at higher risk for hypotension following NTG administration.},

	abstract = {Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important source of morbidity and mortality. However, overtreatment of acute cough illness with antibiotics is an important problem, so improved diagnosis of CAP could help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.
Methods: This was a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of patients with clinically suspected pneumonia or acute cough that used imaging as the reference standard. All studies were reviewed in parallel by two researchers and quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 criteria. Summary measures of accuracy included sensitivity, speciﬁcity, likelihood ratios, the diagnostic odds ratio, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) and were calculated using bivariate meta-analysis.
Results: We identiﬁed 17 studies, of which 12 were judged to be at low risk of bias and the remainder at moderate risk of bias. The prevalence of CAP was 10\% in nine primary care studies and was 20\% in seven emergency department studies. The probability of CAP is increased most by an abnormal overall clinical impression suggesting CAP (positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 6.32, 95\% CI = 3.58 to 10.5), egophony (LR+ = 6.17, 95\% CI = 1.34 to 18.0), dullness to percussion (LR+ = 2.62, 95\% CI = 1.14 to 5.30), and measured temperature (LR+ = 2.52, 95\% CI = 2.02 to 3.20), while it is decreased most by the absence of abnormal vital signs (LRÀ = 0.25, 95\% CI = 0.11 to 0.48). The overall clinical impression also had the highest AUROCC at 0.741.
Conclusions: While most individual signs and symptoms were unhelpful, selected signs and symptoms are of value for diagnosing CAP. Teaching and performing these high value elements of the physical examination should be prioritized, with the goal of better targeting chest radiographs and ultimately antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Background
Assessing the effect of myocardial ischemia on ventricular repolarization in the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB) poses a challenge due to secondary prolongation of the QT interval inherent in LBBB. The T-wave peak to T-wave end (TpTe) interval has been noted to prolong during myocardial ischemia and correct after reperfusion in patients with normal conduction. Here we compare the TpTe intervals of patients with LBBB both with and without complete acute coronary occlusion (ACO).
Methods
Retrospectively, emergency department patients with LBBB and symptoms of myocardial ischemia were identified both with angiographically-proven ACO and with No-ACO. The longest QT, JT, and TpTe intervals were analyzed.
Results
The ACO and No-ACO groups consisted of 33 and 129 patients, respectively. The mean TpTe was longer in ACO (103.6ms [95\%CI 98.5–108.7]) compared to No-ACO patients (88.6ms [95\%CI 85.3–91.9]) (P{\textless}0.0001) and this held true after correction for heart rate. In ACO versus No-ACO, the TpTe also more frequently exceeded prolongation cutoffs of 85ms (30 [90\%] versus 69 [54\%]) and 100ms (25 [76\%] versus 42 [33\%]) (P{\textless}0.0001 for all). The mean QT, JT, QTc, and JTc intervals were not significantly different between the groups for either the Bazett's or Rautaharju's correction formulas.
Conclusions
In patients with LBBB on the ECG, the TpTe is longer and more frequently prolonged in patients with ACO compared to patients without ACO. Future studies of ventricular repolarization in patients with LBBB should include analyses of the TpTe interval.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with ST elevation on electrocardiogram (ECG) could have ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or pericarditis. Spodick's sign, a downsloping of the ECG baseline (the T-P segment), has been described, but not validated, as a sign of pericarditis.
OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the frequency of Spodick's sign and other findings in patients diagnosed with STEMI and those with pericarditis.
METHODS: In this retrospective review, we selected charts that met prospective definitions of STEMI (cases) and pericarditis (controls). We excluded patients whose ECGs lacked ST elevation. An authority on electrocardiography reviewed all ECGs, noting the presence or absence of Spodick's sign, ST depression (in leads besides V1 and aVR), PR depression, greater ST elevation in lead III than in lead II (III {\textgreater} II), abrupt take-off of ST segment (the RT checkmark sign), and upward or horizontal ST convexity. We quantified strength of association using odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients met criteria for STEMI and 42 met those for pericarditis. Spodick's sign occurred in 5\% of patients with STEMI (95\% CI 3-10\%) and 29\% of patients with pericarditis (95\% CI 16-45\%). All other findings statistically distinguished STEMI from pericarditis, but ST depression (OR 31), III {\textgreater} II (OR 21), and absence of PR depression (OR 12) had the greatest OR values.
CONCLUSIONS: Spodick's sign is statistically associated with pericarditis, but it is seen in 5\% of patients with STEMI. Among other findings, ST depression, III {\textgreater} II, and absence of PR depression were the most discriminating.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To predict 72-h and 9-day emergency department (ED) return by using gradient boosting on an expansive set of clinical variables from the electronic health record.

Methods
This retrospective study included all adult discharges from a level 1 trauma center ED and a community hospital ED covering the period of March 2013 to July 2017. A total of 1500 variables were extracted for each visit, and samples split randomly into training, validation, and test sets (80\%, 10\%, and 10\%). Gradient boosting models were fit on 3 selections of the data: administrative data (demographics, prior hospital usage, and comorbidity categories), data available at triage, and the full set of data available at discharge. A logistic regression (LR) model built on administrative data was used for baseline comparison. Finally, the top 20 most informative variables identified from the full gradient boosting models were used to build a reduced model for each outcome.

Results
A total of 330 631 discharges were available for analysis, with 29 058 discharges (8.8\%) resulting in 72-h return and 52 748 discharges (16.0\%) resulting in 9-day return to either ED. LR models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–0.70) and 0.71(95\% CI 0.70–0.72), while gradient boosting models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95\% CI 0.72–0.74) and 0.74 (95\% CI 0.73–0.74) for 72-h and 9-day return, respectively. Gradient boosting models using variables available at triage yielded test AUCs of 0.75 (95\% CI 0.74–0.76) and 0.75 (95\% CI 0.74–0.75), while those using the full set of variables yielded test AUCs of 0.76 (95\% CI 0.75–0.77) and 0.75 (95\% CI 0.75–0.76). Reduced models using the top 20 variables yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71–0.74) and 0.73 (95\% CI 0.72–0.74).

Discussion and Conclusion
Gradient boosting models leveraging clinical data are superior to LR models built on administrative data at predicting 72-h and 9-day returns.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of dyskalemias-hypokalemia and hyperkalemia-currently depends on laboratory tests. Since cardiac tissue is very sensitive to dyskalemia, electrocardiography (ECG) may be able to uncover clinically important dyskalemias before laboratory results.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to develop a deep-learning model, ECG12Net, to detect dyskalemias based on ECG presentations and to evaluate the logic and performance of this model.
METHODS: Spanning from May 2011 to December 2016, 66,321 ECG records with corresponding serum potassium (K+) concentrations were obtained from 40,180 patients admitted to the emergency department. ECG12Net is an 82-layer convolutional neural network that estimates serum K+ concentration. Six clinicians-three emergency physicians and three cardiologists-participated in human-machine competition. Sensitivity, specificity, and balance accuracy were used to evaluate the performance of ECG12Net with that of these physicians.
RESULTS: In a human-machine competition including 300 ECGs of different serum K+ concentrations, the area under the curve for detecting hypokalemia and hyperkalemia with ECG12Net was 0.926 and 0.958, respectively, which was significantly better than that of our best clinicians. Moreover, in detecting hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, the sensitivities were 96.7\% and 83.3\%, respectively, and the specificities were 93.3\% and 97.8\%, respectively. In a test set including 13,222 ECGs, ECG12Net had a similar performance in terms of sensitivity for severe hypokalemia (95.6\%) and severe hyperkalemia (84.5\%), with a mean absolute error of 0.531. The specificities for detecting hypokalemia and hyperkalemia were 81.6\% and 96.0\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning model based on a 12-lead ECG may help physicians promptly recognize severe dyskalemias and thereby potentially reduce cardiac events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding has been a serious issue and demands effective clinical decision-making of patient disposition. In previous studies, emergency clinical narratives provide a rich context for clinical decisions. We aimed to develop the disposition prediction model using deep learning modeling strategy with the heterogeneous data, including the physicians' narratives.
METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort of all 104,083 ED visits of non-trauma adults during 2017-18 from an academically affiliated ED in Taiwan. 18,308 visits were excluded based on the completeness of each record and the unpredictable dispositions, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, against-advice discharge, and escapes. We integrated subjective section of the first physicians' clinical narratives and structured data (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, etc.) as available predictors at the first physician-patient encounter. To predict final patient disposition (i.e., hospitalization or discharge), a deep neural network (DNN) model was developed with word embedding, a common natural language processing method. We compared the proposed model to a reference model using the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score, a logistic regression model with structured data, and a DNN model with paragraph vectors. F1 score was used to measure the predictive performance for each model.
RESULTS: The F1 score (with 95 \% CI) for the proposed model, the reference model, the logistic regression model with structured data, and the DNN model with paragraph vectors were 0.674 (0.669-0.679), 0.474 (0.469-0.479), 0.547 (0.543-0.551), and 0.602 (0.596-0.607), respectively. While analyzing the relationship between context length and predictive performance under the proposed model, the F1 score at 95th percentile of the word counts was higher than that at 25th percentile of the word counts in chief complaint [0.634 (0.629-0.640) vs. 0.624 (0.620-0.628)] and in present illness [0.671 (0.667-0.674) vs. 0.654 (0.651-0.658)], but not in past medical history [0.674 (0.669-0.679) vs. 0.673 (0.666-0.679)].
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed deep learning model with the usage of the first physicians' clinical narratives and structured data based on natural language processing outperformed the commonly used ones in terms of F1 score. It also evidenced the importance of the subjective section of clinical narratives, which serve as vital predictors for ED clinical decision-making.},

Patients received prehospital advanced cardiovascular life support performed by emergency medical technicians (EMTs). EMTs were directly supervised by medical directors (physicians) via real-time smartphone video calls [Smart Advanced Life Support (SALS)]. The study participants were categorized into rearrest (+) and rearrest (-) groups depending on whether rearrest occurred after prehospital ROSC. After rearrest, patients were further classified as survivors or non-survivors at discharge.Results: SALS was performed in 1,711 OHCA patients. Prehospital ROSC occurred in 345 patients (20.2\%); of these patients, 189 (54.8\%) experienced rearrest [rearrest (+) group] and 156 did not experience rearrest [rearrest (-) group]. Multivariate analysis showed that a longer interval from collapse to first prehospital ROSC was independently associated with rearrest [odds ratio (OR) 1.081; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.050-1.114]. The presence of an initial shockable rhythm was independently associated with survival after rearrest (OR 6.920; 95\% CI 2.749-17.422). As a predictor of rearrest, the interval from collapse to first prehospital ROSC (cut-off: 24 min) had a sensitivity of 77\% and a specificity of 54\% (AUC = 0.715 [95\% CI 0.661-0.769]).Conclusions: A longer interval from collapse to first prehospital ROSC was associated with rearrest, and an initial shockable rhythm was associated with survival despite the occurrence of rearrest. Emergency medical service providers and physicians should be prepared to deal with rearrest when pulses are obtained late in the resuscitation.},

	abstract = {The use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E‐CPR) for the treatment of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest who do not respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR) has increased significantly in the past 10 years, in response to case reports and observational studies reporting encouraging results. However, no randomized controlled trials comparing E‐CPR with conventional CPR have been published to date. The evidence from systematic reviews of the available observational studies is conflicting. The inclusion criteria for published E‐CPR studies are variable, but most commonly include witnessed arrest, immediate bystander CPR, an initial shockable rhythm, and an estimated time from CPR start to establishment of E‐CPR (low‐flow time) of {\textless}60 minutes. A shorter low‐flow time has been consistently associated with improved survival. In an effort to reduce low‐flow times, commencement of E‐CPR in the prehospital setting has been reported and is currently under investigation. The provision of an E‐CPR service, whether hospital based or prehospital, carries considerable cost and technical challenges. Despite increased adoption, many questions remain as to which patients will derive the most benefit from E‐CPR, when and where to implement E‐CPR, optimal post‐arrest E‐CPR care, and whether this complex invasive intervention is cost‐effective. Results of ongoing trials are awaited to determine whether E‐CPR improves survival when compared with conventional CPR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: -The best cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) technique for survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) has been intensively discussed in the recent few years. However, most analyses focused on comparison at individual level and how well the dissemination of bystander-initiated chest compression-only CPR (CCCPR) increases survival after OHCAs at the population level remains unclear. We therefore evaluated the impact of nationwide dissemination of bystander-initiated CCCPR on the survival after OHCA.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS AND RESULTS: -A nationwide, prospective, population-based observational study covering the whole population of Japan and involving consecutive OHCA patients with resuscitation attempts was conducted from January 2005 through December 2012. The main outcome measure was one-month survival with favorable neurologic outcome. The incidence of survival with favorable neurologic outcome attributed by types of bystander CPR (CCCPR and conventional CPR with rescue breathing) was estimated. Among 816,385 OHCAs before emergency-medical-services arrival, 249,970 (30.6\%) received CCCPR, 100,469 (12.3\%) conventional CPR, and 465,946 (57.1\%) no CPR. The proportion of OHCA patients receiving CCCPR or any CPR (either CCCPR or conventional CPR) by bystanders increased from 17.4\% to 39.3\% (P for trend {\textless}0.001) and 34.6\% to 47.3\% (P for trend {\textless}0.001), respectively. The incidence of survival with favorable neurologic outcome attributed by CCCPR per 10 million population significantly increased from 0.6 to 28.3 (P for trend=0.010), and that by any bystander-initiated CPR significantly increased from 9.0 to 43.6 (P for trend=0.003).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: -Nationwide dissemination of CCCPR for lay-rescuers was associated with the increase in the incidence of survival with favorable neurologic outcome after OHCAs in Japan.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rhythm analysis algorithm (RAA) of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) may be deceived by many factors. In this observational study we assessed RAA accuracy in prehospital interventions. For every rhythm analysis judged to be inaccurate, we looked for causal factors and estimated the impact on outcome. METHODS: In 135 consecutive patients, two physicians reviewed 837 rhythm analyses independently. When they disagreed, a third physician made the final decision. RESULTS: Among 148 shockable episodes, 23 (16\%) were not recognized by the RAA due to external artifacts (n=7), fine ventricular fibrillation (VF; n=7), RAA error without external artifacts (n=4) or a combination of factors (n=5). In six cases the omitted/delayed shock was judged to be of clinical relevance: survival with some neurological deficit (n=4), death without regaining consciousness (n=1) and no restoration of spontaneous circulation (n=1). In 689 non-shockable episodes, the RAA decided "shockable" 25 times (4\%). This wrongful decision was due to external artifacts (n=9), a concurrent shock of an internal cardioverter defibrillator (n=1), RAA error without external artifacts (n=13) or a combination of factors (n=2). Fifteen spurious shocks were delivered. As these non-shockable rhythms did not deteriorate after the shock, we assumed that no significant harm was done. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 16\% of shockable rhythms were not detected and 4\% of non-shockable rhythms were interpreted as shockable. Therefore, all AED interventions should be reviewed. Feedback to caregivers may avoid future deleterious interactions with the AED, whereas AED manufacturers may use this information to improve RAA accuracy. This approach may improve the outcome of some VF patients.},

	abstract = {Background Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for comatose adults after witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but data about this intervention in children are limited. Methods We conducted this trial of two targeted temperature interventions at 38 children's hospitals involving children who remained unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Within 6 hours after the return of circulation, comatose patients who were older than 2 days and younger than 18 years of age were randomly assigned to therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 33.0°C) or therapeutic normothermia (target temperature, 36.8°C). The primary efficacy outcome, survival at 12 months after cardiac arrest with a Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II), score of 70 or higher (on a scale from 20 to 160, with higher scores indicating better function), was evaluated among patients with a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest. Results A total of 295 patients underwent randomization. Among the 260 patients with data that could be evaluated and who had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group (20\% vs. 12\%; relative likelihood, 1.54; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 2.76; P=0.14). Among all the patients with data that could be evaluated, the change in the VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months was not significantly different (P=0.13) and 1-year survival was similar (38\% in the hypothermia group vs. 29\% in the normothermia group; relative likelihood, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 1.79; P=0.13). The groups had similar incidences of infection and serious arrhythmias, as well as similar use of blood products and 28-day mortality. Conclusions In comatose children who survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, therapeutic hypothermia, as compared with therapeutic normothermia, did not confer a significant benefit in survival with a good functional outcome at 1 year.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) access has an essential role in the care provided for trauma patients, allowing for transfusion of blood products, fluids, and drugs. Decisions should be made regarding the necessity of IV access while considering cost-benefit of the procedure in terms of delayed evacuation times.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all trauma patients in whom at least one attempt at IV access was performed were reviewed. Data were abstracted from the Israeli Defense Force Trauma Registry.

RESULTS: Of 7,476 patients, 1,082 patients who had at least one documented attempt at IV access between January 1997 and April 2013 were included in this study. Overall cumulative success rate at IV access was 82\%. Success rates for IV access were 86\%, 68\%, 63\%, 50\%, 20\% for the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth attempts, respectively. The first and second attempts accounted for 96\% of the successful procedures. Mortality in patients for whom IV access was successful was 13\%; mortality in patients for whom IV access was not successful was 35\%.

CONCLUSION: The success rate of IV access declined with each subsequent attempt. There was minimal improvement of overall success rate seen after the second attempt. Our findings suggest that the inability to obtain peripheral venous access is associated with severe injuries. These finding support a policy of limiting the number of venous access attempts to two attempts, followed by a reevaluation of need for parenteral access. Improved training of combat medics and paramedics might marginally increase the success rates of IV access. Point-of-injury data, used for ongoing learning and research, form the ground for improving combat casualty care and thus help saving lives.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The serum rise of cardiac troponin remains the gold standard for diagnosing non-ST elevation (NSTE) myocardial infarction (MI) despite its delayed response. Novel methods for real-time detection of NSTEMI would result in more immediate initiation of definitive medical therapy and faster transport to facilities that can provide specialized cardiac care.

METHODS: EMPIRE is an ongoing prospective, observational cohort study designed to quantify the magnitude of ischemia-induced repolarization dispersion for the early detection of NSTEMI. In this ongoing study, prehospital ECG data is gathered from patients who call 9-1-1 with a chief complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. This data is then analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique of 12-lead ECGs to fully characterize the spatial and temporal qualities of STT waveforms.

RESULTS: Between May and December of 2013, Pittsburgh EMS obtained and transmitted 351 prehospital ECGs of the 1149 patients with chest pain-related emergency dispatches transported to participating hospitals. After excluding those with poor ECG signal (n=40, 11\%) and those with pacing or LBBB (n=50, 14\%), there were 261 eligible patients (age 57±16years, 45\% female, 45\% Black). In this preliminary sample, there were 19 STEMI (7\%) and 33 NSTEMI (12\%). More than 50\% of those with infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) had initially negative troponin values upon presentation. We present ECG data of such NSTEMI case that was identified correctly using our methods.

CONCLUSIONS: Concrete ECG algorithms that can quantify NSTE ischemia and allow differential treatment based on such ECG changes could have an immediate clinical impact on patient outcomes. We describe the rationale, development, design, and potential usefulness of the EMPIRE study. The findings may provide insights that can influence guidelines revisions and improve public health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common dysrhythmia treated in the prehospital setting. Emergency medical service (EMS) agencies typically require patients treated for SVT to be transported to the hospital. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact, paramedic adherence, and patient re-presentation rates of a treat-and-release (T+R) protocol for uncomplicated SVT.

METHODS: Data were linked from the Alberta Health Services EMS electronic patient care record (EPCR) database for the City of Calgary to the Regional Emergency Department Information System (REDIS). All SVT patients treated by EMS between September 1, 2010, and September 30, 2012, were identified. Databases were queried to identify re-presentations to EMS or an emergency department (ED) within 72 hours of T+R.

RESULTS: There were 229 confirmed SVT patient encounters, including 75 T+R events. Of these 75 T+R events, 10 (13\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] [7.4, 23]) led to an EMS re-presentation within 72 hours, and 4 (5\%, 95\% CI [2.1, 13]) led to an ED. All re-presentations were attributed to a single individual. After excluding 15 records that were incomplete due to limitations in the EPCR platform, 43 of 60 (72\%) T+R encounters met all protocol criteria for T+R.

CONCLUSION: The T+R protocol evaluated in this study applied to a significant proportion of patients presenting to EMS with SVT. Risk of re-presentation following T+R was low, and paramedic protocol adherence was reasonable. T+R appears to be a viable option for uncomplicated SVT in the prehospital setting.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of prehospital tourniquet use in an urban, civilian EMS setting.

METHODS: A retrospective review of EMS prehospital care reports was performed from January 1, 2005 to December 1, 2012. Data, including the time duration of prehospital tourniquet placement, EMS scene time, mechanisms of injury, and patient demographics, underwent descriptive analysis. Outcomes data for participating receiving hospitals were also reviewed.

RESULTS: Ninety-eight cases of prehospital tourniquet use were identified. The most common causes of injury were penetrating gunshot or stabbing wounds (67.4\%, 66/98); 7.1\% (7/98) of cases were due to blunt trauma; 23.5\% (23/98) of cases were from nontraumatic hemorrhage related to uncontrolled hemodialysis shunt or wound bleeding; 45.4\% (44/97) of cases were placed on a lower extremity; 54.6\% (53/97) were placed on an upper extremity. Placement was successful in hemorrhage control in 91\% (87/95, 95\%CI: 85.9-97.3\%) of cases. The average prehospital tourniquet placement time was 14.9 minutes. Half of all tourniquet placements were performed by basic life support providers. Hospital follow-up was available for 96.9\% (95/98) of cases. Of these, the tourniquet was removed by EMS in 3.2\% (3/95), the emergency department in 54.7\% (52/95), or in the operating room (OR) in 31.6\% (30/95) of the time; 46.7\% (14/30) of these OR cases had a documented vascular injury needing repair. Ten deaths with hospital follow-up data were identified, none of which were due to tourniquet use. There was one case of forearm numbness potentially due to nerve injury and one case with potential vascular complication, representing an overall complication rate of 2.1\% (2/95).

CONCLUSION: The early use of tourniquets for extremity hemorrhage in an urban civilian EMS setting appears to be safe, with complications occurring infrequently.},

We studied patients receiving intravenous metoprolol by EMS and compared them with others treated by EMS but not receiving intravenous metoprolol. Outcomes included infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 1 week, and safety by measuring the incidence of the predefined combined endpoint (composite of death, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, advanced atrioventricular block, cardiogenic shock, or reinfarction) within the first 24 hours.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: From the total population of the trial (N=270), 147 patients (54\%) were recruited during out-of-hospital assistance and transferred to the primary angioplasty center (74 intravenous metoprolol and 73 controls). Infarct size was smaller in patients receiving intravenous metoprolol compared with controls (23.4 [SD 15.0] versus 34.0 [SD 23.7] g; adjusted difference -11.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI] -18.6 to -4.3).

RESULTS: Of 735 patients (mean age 70.5, 52.4\% male), 68 (9.3\%) patients had completely normal PH ECG findings. They experienced significantly less adverse hospital outcomes (12\% vs 37\%), length of stay (1.19 vs 3.86 days), and long-term mortality (9\% vs 28\%) than those with any PH ECG abnormality (p{\textless}.05).

CONCLUSION: Normal PH ECG findings are associated with better short and long-term outcomes in ambulance patients with ischemic symptoms. These findings may enhance early triage and risk stratification in emergency cardiac care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxygen is commonly administered to patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) despite previous studies suggesting a possible increase in myocardial injury due to coronary vasoconstriction and heightened oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing oxygen (8 L/min) with no supplemental oxygen in patients with STEMI diagnosed on paramedic 12-lead electrocardiogram. Of 638 patients randomized, 441 were confirmed STEMI patients who underwent primary endpoint analysis. The primary endpoint was myocardial infarct size as assessed by cardiac enzymes, troponin (cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK). Secondary endpoints included recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarct size assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at 6 months. Mean peak troponin was similar in the oxygen and no oxygen groups (57.4 mcg/L vs. 48.0 mcg/L; ratio, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.56; P=0.18). There was a significant increase in mean peak CK in the oxygen group compared to the no oxygen group (1948 U/L vs. 1543 U/L; means ratio, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.04 to 1.52; P= 0.01). There was an increase in the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction in the oxygen group compared to the no oxygen group (5.5\%vs.0.9\%, P=0.006) and an increase in frequency of cardiac arrhythmia (40.4\% vs. 31.4\%; P=0.05). At 6-months the oxygen group had an increase in myocardial infarct size on CMR (n=139; 20.3 grams vs. 13.1 grams; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with STEMI but without hypoxia may increase early myocardial injury and was associated with larger myocardial infarct size assessed at six months.

The optimal approach for those without STEMI post–cardiac arrest is less clear. {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS{\textbackslash}nA retrospective evaluation of a post–cardiac arrest registry was performed. {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS{\textbackslash}nThe database consisted of 746 comatose post–cardiac arrest patients including 198 with STEMI (26.5\%) and 548 without STEMI (73.5\%). Overall survival was greater in those with STEMI compared with those without (55.1\% vs. 41.3\%; p = 0.001), whereas in all patients who underwent immediate coronary angiography, survival was similar between those with and without STEMI (54.7\% vs. 57.9\%; p = 0.60). A culprit vessel was more frequently identified in those with STEMI, but also in one-third of patients without STEMI (80.2\% vs. 33.2\%; p = 0.001). The majority of culprit vessels were occluded (STEMI, 92.7\%; no STEMI, 69.2\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). An occluded culprit vessel was found in 74.3\% of STEMI patients and in 22.9\% of no STEMI patients. Among cardiac arrest survivors discharged from the hospital who had presented without STEMI, coronary angiography was associated with better functional outcome (93.3\% vs. 78.7\%; p {\textless} 0.003). {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS{\textbackslash}nEarly coronary angiography is associated with improved functional outcome among resuscitated patients with and without STEMI.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three million people in Sweden are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Whether this training increases the frequency of bystander CPR or the survival rate among persons who have out-of-hospital cardiac arrests has been questioned.

METHODS: We analyzed a total of 30,381 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests witnessed in Sweden from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2011, to determine whether CPR was performed before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) and whether early CPR was correlated with survival.

RESULTS: CPR was performed before the arrival of EMS in 15,512 cases (51.1\%) and was not performed before the arrival of EMS in 14,869 cases (48.9\%). The 30-day survival rate was 10.5\% when CPR was performed before EMS arrival versus 4.0\% when CPR was not performed before EMS arrival (P{\textless}0.001). When adjustment was made for a propensity score (which included the variables of age, sex, location of cardiac arrest, cause of cardiac arrest, initial cardiac rhythm, EMS response time, time from collapse to call for EMS, and year of event), CPR before the arrival of EMS was associated with an increased 30-day survival rate (odds ratio, 2.15; 95\% confidence interval, 1.88 to 2.45). When the time to defibrillation in patients who were found to be in ventricular fibrillation was included in the propensity score, the results were similar. The positive correlation between early CPR and survival rate remained stable over the course of the study period. An association was also observed between the time from collapse to the start of CPR and the 30-day survival rate.

CONCLUSIONS: CPR performed before EMS arrival was associated with a 30-day survival rate after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that was more than twice as high as that associated with no CPR before EMS arrival. (Funded by the Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine and others.).},

	abstract = {AIM: Current consensus guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) recommend that chest compressions resume immediately after defibrillation attempts and that rhythm and pulse checks be deferred until completion of 5 compression:ventilation cycles or minimally for 2min. However, data specifically confirming the post-shock duration of asystole or pulseless electrical activity before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are lacking. Our aim was to describe the frequency of the various post-shock cardiac rhythms and the duration of post-shock pulselessness in out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest.

METHOD: Using prospectively-collected data from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epistry database, the investigators reviewed monitor-defibrillator recordings of 176 patients who received defibrillation attempts in the out-of-hospital setting for ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) with absent pulses,.

RESULTS: Among 376 different defibrillation attempts delivered in the 176 patients, there were 182 resulting episodes of post-shock asystole. The mean interval of asystole after defibrillation was 69±136s (median 20s; IQR 36) and the mean interval for return of an organized rhythm was 64±157s (median 7s; IQR 26). The mean time to ROSC was 280±320s (median 136s; IQR 445).

CONCLUSION: After defibrillation attempts, the majority of patients remain pulseless for over 2min and the duration of asystole before return of pulses is longer than 120s beyond the shock gap in as many as 25\%. These data support the recommendation to immediately resume chest compressions for 2min following attempted defibrillation.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Patient handoffs are known as high-risk events for medical error but little is known about the professional, structural, and interpersonal factors that can affect the patient transition from emergency medical services (EMS) care to the emergency department (ED). We study EMS providers' perspectives to generate hypotheses to inform and improve this handoff.

METHODS: We conducted focus groups with EMS providers recruited at 3 national and regional conferences from January to March 2011 until theme saturation was reached; 7 focus groups were conducted with 48 EMS providers. Deidentified transcripts and notes were entered into QSR NVivo, coded, and analyzed to identify themes.

RESULTS: EMS providers identified themselves as advocates for their patients during the challenging EMS-to-ED handoffs. Providers identified normative challenges they encounter in their communications with hospital staff, and features of EMS and hospital protocols that either facilitate or undermine effective handoffs from the out-of-hospital environment to the ED. They identified 4 key potential ways to improve the structure and process of the handoff: (1) communicate directly with the ED provider responsible for the patient's care; (2) increase interdisciplinary feedback, transparency, and shared understanding of scope of practice between out-of-hospital and hospital-based providers; (3) standardize some (but not all) aspects of the handoff; and (4) harness technology to close gaps in information exchange.

CONCLUSION: These exploratory findings suggest that the effect of increasing EMS interactions with emergency physicians, standardizing handoff processes, and fostering interprofessional learning represent opportunities for future study and may serve as potential solutions for the high-risk EMS-ED patient transition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-shock pause duration of {\textless}20s is associated with improved survival after cardiac arrest. Manual mode defibrillation has been associated with the shortest duration of pre-shock pause but is largely practiced by advanced life support paramedics (ALS) whereas defibrillator only paramedics (basic life support or BLS) routinely use the defibrillator in automatic mode.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the relationship between manual mode defibrillation, pre-shock pause duration and rate of inappropriate shocks when defibrillation is provided by ALS vs. BLS trained in manual mode defibrillation.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all treated non-traumatic adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) presenting in a shockable rhythm over a one year period beginning January 1, 2012. Our primary outcome measure was the proportion of manual mode shocks delivered by BLS with pre-shock pause duration of {\textless}20s when compared to ALS. Our secondary outcome measures were the duration of pre-, post- and peri-shock pause and the proportion of appropriate shocks (defined as correct identification and shock delivery to patients in a shockable rhythm) delivered by either level of paramedic. This study had a power of 90\% to detect an absolute difference of 15\% between paramedic levels in proportion of shocks delivered with pre-shock pause duration {\textless}20s.

RESULTS: Among 2019 treated OHCA, 335 (20\%) presented in a shockable rhythm. Manual defibrillation was performed in 155 (46\%) of these cases (196 shocks by ALS, 143 shocks by BLS). There were no differences in the proportion of shocks delivered with pre-shock pause duration {\textless}20s (ALS 82.8\% vs. BLS 84.8\%, p=.65) nor pre-shock pause duration (s) (median, Q1, Q3); ALS: 12.0 (7.0,17.0) vs. BLS: 11.0 (5.0,17.0), p=.13 while BLS had a significantly shorter peri-shock pause duration (s) (median, Q1, Q3); ALS: 17.0 (12.0, 23.0) vs. BLS: 15.0 (9.0, 22.0), p=.05. There were no differences in the rate of inappropriate shocks (ALS 1.0\% vs. BLS 0.7\%), p=1.0 between levels of paramedics.

CONCLUSIONS: Manual mode defibrillation by BLS paramedics produced similar measures of pre-shock pause duration when compared to ALS paramedics without increasing the incidence of inappropriate shocks. Further study is required to determine the potential impact of BLS manual mode defibrillation on clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced prehospital interventions for severe brain injury remains controversial. No previous randomised trial has been conducted to evaluate additional physician intervention compared with paramedic only care.

METHODS: Participants in this prospective, randomised controlled trial were adult patients with blunt trauma with either a scene GCS score {\textless}9 (original definition), or GCS{\textless}13 and an Abbreviated Injury Scale score for the head region ≥3 (modified definition). Patients were randomised to either standard ground paramedic treatment or standard treatment plus a physician arriving by helicopter. Patients were evaluated by 30-day mortality and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. Due to high non-compliance rates, both intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses were preplanned.

RESULTS: 375 patients met the original definition, of which 197 was allocated to physician care. Differences in the 6-month GOS scores were not significant on intention-to-treat analysis (OR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.66, p=0.62) nor was the 30-day mortality (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.60 to 1.38, p=0.66). As-treated analysis showed a 16\% reduction in 30-day mortality in those receiving additional physician care; 60/195 (29\%) versus 81/180 (45\%), p{\textless}0.01, Number needed to treat =6. 338 patients met the modified definition, of which 182 were allocated to physician care. The 6-month GOS scores were not significantly different on intention-to-treat analysis (OR 1.14, 95\% CI 0.73 to 1.75, p=0.56) nor was the 30-day mortality (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.66 to 1.66, p=0.84). As-treated analyses were also not significantly different.

CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests a potential mortality reduction in patients with blunt trauma with GCS{\textless}9 receiving additional physician care (original definition only). Confirmatory studies which also address non-compliance issues are needed.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute pain in trauma patients in emergency care is still undertreated. Early pain treatment is assumed to effectively reduce pain in patients and improve long-term outcomes. In order to improve pain management in the chain of emergency care, a national evidence-based guideline was developed. The aim of this study was to assess whether current practice is in compliance with the guideline 'Pain management for trauma patients in the chain of emergency care' from the Netherlands Association for Emergency Nurses (in Dutch NVSHV), and to evaluate early and initial pain management for adult trauma patients in emergency care.

METHODS: Chart reviews were conducted in three regions of the Netherlands using electronic patient files of trauma patients from the chain of emergency care. We included one after-hours General Practitioner Co-operation (GPC), one ambulance Emergency Medical Services (EMS), two Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS), and three Emergency Departments (EDs). Organisation of pain management, pain assessment, and pain treatment was examined and compared with national guideline recommendations, including quality indicators.

RESULTS: We assessed a random sample of 1066 electronic patient files. The use of standardised tools to assess pain was registered in zero to 52\% of the electronic patient files per organisation. Registration of (non-)pharmacological pain treatment was found in less than half of the files. According to the files, pharmacological pain treatment deviated from the guideline in 73-99\% of the files. Time of administration of medication was missing in 73-100\%. Reassessment of pain following pain medication was recorded in half of the files by the HEMS, but not in files of the other organisations.

CONCLUSIONS: The (registration of) current pain management in trauma patients in the chain of emergency care varies widely between healthcare organisation, and deviates from national guideline recommendations. Although guideline compliance differs across groups of healthcare professionals, maximum compliance rate with indicators registered is 52\%. In order to improve pain management and evaluate its effectiveness, we recommend to improve pain registration in patient files. Furthermore, we advise to identify barriers and facilitators related to the implementation of the national guideline in all emergency care organisations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with ST-segment elevations (STEs) following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) should be referred for an acute coronary angiography. We sought to investigate the diagnostic value of the pre-hospital ROSC-ECG in predicting ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

METHOD: ROSC-ECGs of 145 comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomly assigned in the Target Temperature Management trial, were classified according to the current STEMI ECG criteria (third universal definition of myocardial infarction).

RESULTS: STEs were present in the pre-hospital ROSC-ECG of 78 (54\%) patients. A final diagnosis revealed that 69 (48\%) patients had STEMI, 31 (21\%) patients had non-STEMI and 45 (31\%) patients had no myocardial infarction. STE in ROSC-ECGs had a sensitivity of 74\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 62-84), specificity of 65\% (95\% CI 53-75) and a positive and negative predictive value of 65\% (95\% CI 54-76) and 73\% (95\% CI 61-83) in predicting STEMI. Time to ROSC was significantly longer (24 minutes vs. 19 minutes, P=0.02) in STE compared with no STE patients. Percutaneous coronary intervention was successful in 68\% versus 36\% (P{\textless}0.001) of STE compared to no STE patients. No significant difference was found in 180-day mortality rates between STE and no STE patients (36\% vs. 30\%, Plogrank=0.37).

CONCLUSION: The pre-hospital ROSC-ECG is a suboptimal diagnostic tool to predict STEMI and therefore not a sensitive tool for triage to cardiac centres. This supports the incentive of referring all comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of suspected cardiac origin to a tertiary heart centre with the availability of acute coronary angiography, even in the absence of STEs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oxygen desaturation occurs frequently in the course of prehospital rapid sequence intubation (RSI) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Preoxygenation with positive pressure ventilation by bag valve mask may delay the onset of desaturation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate implementation of a targeted preoxygenation protocol including the use of positive pressure ventilation on desaturation events and intubation success during air medical RSI.

METHODS: The RSI air medical program airway training model was modified to target an oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry value of ≥ 93\% before initial laryngoscopy. A review of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry tracings was performed for 2 years before and 2 years after implementation of this protocol. The incidence of desaturation events and overall intubation success rates were compared before and after the intervention.

RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five RSI procedures were evaluated over the study period. Desaturation events decreased from 58\% in the 2 years before algorithm changes to 28\% in the first year and 14\% in the second year after implementation (P {\textless} .01). Intubation success rates increased from 89\% to 98\% (P {\textless} .01). There were no self-reports of aspiration events during the study period.

CONCLUSION: A preoxygenation protocol dramatically reduced the incidence of desaturation events and increased intubation success without an increase in the number of reported aspiration events.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Overall survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is less than 10\%. After initial bag-valve mask ventilation, 80\% of patients receive an advanced airway, either by endotracheal intubation (ETI) or placement of a supraglottic airway (SGA). The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare patient outcomes for these two advanced airway methods in OHCA patients treated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).

METHODS: A dual-reviewer search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database to identify all relevant peer-reviewed articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Exclusion criteria were traumatic arrests, pediatric patients, physician/nurse intubators, rapid sequence intubation, video devices, and older airway devices. Outcomes were (1) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), (2) survival to hospital admission, (3) survival to hospital discharge, and (4) neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge. Results were adjusted for covariates when available and combined using the random effects model.

RESULTS: From 3,454 titles, 10 observational studies fulfilled all criteria, representing 34,533 ETI patients and 41,116 SGA patients. Important covariates were similar between groups. Patients who received ETI had statistically significant higher odds of ROSC (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.55), survival to hospital admission (OR 1.34, CI 1.03-1.75), and neurologically intact survival (OR 1.33, CI 1.09-1.61) compared to SGA. Survival to hospital discharge was not statistically different (OR 1.15, CI 0.97-1.37).

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OHCA who receive ETI by EMS are more likely to obtain ROSC, survive to hospital admission, and survive neurologically intact when compared to SGA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Intravenous access in prehospital emergency care allows for early administration of medication and extended measures such as anaesthesia. Cannulation may, however, be difficult, and failure and resulting delay in treatment and transport may have negative effects on the patient. Therefore, our study aims to perform a concise assessment of the difficulties of prehospital venous cannulation.

METHODS: We analysed 23 candidate predictor variables on peripheral venous cannulations in terms of cannulation failure and exceedance of a 2 min time threshold. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted for variables of predictive value (P{\textless}0.25) and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC{\textgreater}0.6) of their respective receiver operating characteristic curve.

RESULTS: A total of 762 intravenous cannulations were enroled. In all, 22\% of punctures failed on the first attempt and 13\% of punctures exceeded 2 min. Model selection yielded a three-factor model (vein visibility without tourniquet, vein palpability with tourniquet and insufficient ambient lighting) of fair accuracy for the prediction of puncture failure (AUC=0.76) and a structurally congruent model of four factors (failure model factors plus vein visibility with tourniquet) for the exceedance of the 2 min threshold (AUC=0.80).

CONCLUSION: Our study offers a simple assessment to identify cases of difficult intravenous access in prehospital emergency care. Of the numerous factors subjectively perceived as possibly exerting influences on cannulation, only the universal - not exclusive to emergency care - factors of lighting, vein visibility and palpability proved to be valid predictors of cannulation failure and exceedance of a 2 min threshold.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate patients with shock and traumatic brain injury who were previously enrolled in an out-of-hospital clinical trial to test the association between out-of-hospital time and outcome.

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of patients with shock and traumatic brain injury who were aged 15 years or older and enrolled in a Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium out-of-hospital clinical trial by 81 emergency medical services agencies transporting to 46 Level I and II trauma centers in 11 sites (May 2006 through May 2009). Inclusion criteria were systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 70 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 71 to 90 mm Hg with pulse rate greater than or equal to 108 beats/min (shock cohort) and Glasgow Coma Scale score less than or equal to 8 (traumatic brain injury cohort); patients meeting both criteria were placed in the shock cohort. Primary outcomes were 28-day mortality (shock cohort) and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score less than or equal to 4 (traumatic brain injury cohort).

RESULTS: There were 778 patients in the shock cohort (26\% 28-day mortality) and 1,239 patients in the traumatic brain injury cohort (53\% 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score ≤4). Out-of-hospital time greater than 60 minutes was not associated with worse outcomes after accounting for important confounders in the shock cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.42; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 2.62) or traumatic brain injury cohort (aOR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.51 to 1.15). However, shock patients requiring early critical hospital resources and arriving after 60 minutes had higher 28-day mortality (aOR 2.37; 95\% CI 1.05 to 5.37); this finding was not observed among a similar traumatic brain injury subgroup.

CONCLUSION: Among out-of-hospital trauma patients meeting physiologic criteria for shock and traumatic brain injury, there was no association between time and outcome. However, the subgroup of shock patients requiring early critical resources and arriving after 60 minutes had higher mortality.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Introduction Recent studies have brought to question the efficacy of the use of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Though guidelines recommend therapeutic hypothermia as a critical link in the chain of survival, the safety of this intervention, with the possibility of minimal treatment benefit, becomes important. Hypothesis/Problem This study examined prehospital therapeutic hypothermia for OHCA, its association with survival, and its complication profile in a large, metropolitan, fire-based Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system, where bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and post-arrest care are in the process of being optimized.

METHODS: This evaluation was a retrospective chart review of all OHCA patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) treated with therapeutic hypothermia, from January 1, 2013 through November 30, 2013. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with initiation of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia with survival to hospital admission, the proportion of patients with initiation of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia with survival to hospital discharge, and the complication profile of therapeutic hypothermia in this population. The complication profile included several clinical, radiographic, and laboratory parameters. Exclusion criteria included: no prehospital therapeutic hypothermia initiation; no ROSC; and age of 17 year old or younger.

RESULTS: Fifty-one post-cardiac arrest patients were identified that met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 61 years (SD=14.7 years), and 33 (72\%) were male. The initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 17 (37\%) patients, and bystander CPR was performed in 28 (61\%) patients with ROSC. Thirty-nine (85\%) patients survived to hospital admission. Twenty-one patients (48\%; 95\% CI, 33-64) were administered vasopressors, 10 patients (24\%; 95\% CI, 10-37) were administered diuretics, and 19 patients (44\%; 95\% CI, 29-60) were administered antibiotics. Initial chest radiograph (CXR) findings were normal in 12 (29\%) patients. Overall, 13 (28\%; 95\% CI, 15-42) study patients survived to hospital discharge.

CONCLUSION: Recent reports have questioned the efficacy and safety of prehospital therapeutic hypothermia. In this evaluation, in the setting of unstandardized post-arrest care, 85\% of the patients survived to hospital admission and 28\% survived to hospital discharge, with a complication profile which was similar to that noted in other studies. This suggests that further evidence may be needed before EMS systems stop administering therapeutic hypothermia to appropriately selected patients. In less-optimized systems, therapeutic hypothermia may still be an essential link in the chain of survival. Cortez E , Panchal AR , Davis J , Zeeb P , Keseg DP .

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment guidelines for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) recommend risk stratifying patients to assess PE severity, as those at higher risk should be considered for therapy in addition to standard anticoagulation to prevent right ventricular (RV) failure, which can cause hemodynamic collapse. The hypothesis was that 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) can aid in this determination. The objective of this study was to measure the prognostic value of specific ECG findings (the Daniel score, which includes heart rate {\textgreater} 100 beats/min, presence of the S1Q3T3 pattern, incomplete and complete right bundle branch block [RBBB], and T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4, plus ST elevation in lead aVR and atrial fibrillation suggestive of RV strain from acute pulmonary hypertension), in patients with acute PE.

METHODS: Studies were identified by a structured search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Scopus, and bibliographies in October 2014. Case reports, non-English papers, and those that lacked either patient outcomes or ECG findings were excluded. Papers with evidence of a predefined reference standard for PE and the results of 12-lead ECG, stratified by outcome (hemodynamic collapse, defined as circulatory shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, or in hospital or death within 30 days) were included. Papers were assessed for selection and publication bias. The authors also assessed heterogeneity (I(2) ) and calculated the odds ratios (OR) for each ECG sign from the random effects model if I(2) {\textgreater} 24\% and fixed effects if I(2) {\textless} 25\%. Funnel plots were used to examine for publication bias.

RESULTS: Forty-five full-length studies of 8,209 patients were analyzed. The most frequent ECG signs found in patients with acute PE were tachycardia (38\%), T-wave inversion in lead V1 (38\%), and ST elevation in lead aVR (36\%). Ten studies with 3,007 patients were included for full analysis. Six ECG findings (heart rate {\textgreater} 100 beats/min, S1Q3T3, complete RBBB, inverted T waves in V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, and atrial fibrillation) had likelihood and ORs with lower-limit 95\% confidence intervals above unity, suggesting them to be significant predictors of hemodynamic collapse and 30-day mortality. OR data showed no evidence of publication bias, but the proportions of patients with hemodynamic collapse or death and S1Q3T3 and RBBB tended to be higher in smaller studies. Patients who were outcome-negative had a significantly lower mean ± SD Daniel score (2.6 ± 1.5) than patients with hemodynamic collapse (5.9 ± 3.9; p = 0.039, ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc), but not patients with all-cause 30-day mortality (4.9 ± 3.3; p = 0.12).

CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed 10 studies, including 3,007 patients with acute PE, that demonstrate that six findings of RV strain on 12-lead ECG (heart rate {\textgreater} 100 beats/min, S1Q3T3, complete RBBB, inverted T waves in V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, and atrial fibrillation) are associated with increased risk of circulatory shock and death.},

	abstract = {The electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represents a challenge to all health care providers, particularly so for the novice ECG interpreter. We have developed-and present in this article-a 4-step algorithm that will detect STEMI in most instances in the prehospital and other nonemergency department (ED) settings. The algorithm should be used in adult patients with chest pain or equivalent presentation who are suspected of STEMI. It inquires as to the presence of ST-segment elevation as well as the presence of STEMI confounding/mimicking patterns; the algorithm also makes use of reciprocal ST-segment depression as an adjunct in the ECG diagnosis of STEMI. If STEMI is detected by this algorithm, then management decisions can be made based upon this ECG diagnosis. If STEMI is not detected using this algorithm, then we can only note that STEMI is not "ruled in"; importantly, STEMI is not "ruled out." In fact, more expert interpretation of the ECG will be possible once the patient (and/or the ECG) arrive in the ED where ECG review can be made with the more complex interpretation used by expert physician interpreters. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Animal studies, case reports, case series, case-control studies, randomized controlled studies and systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion. Opinion articles with no reference to data were excluded. Of 45 unique results, 3 articles merited inclusion. A total of 10 patients with LVADs received chest compression during resuscitation. There was no report of device dislodgement as judged by postarrest flow rate, autopsy and resumption of effective circulation and/or neurological function. The longest duration of chest compression was 150 min. However, there are no comparisons of the efficacy of chest compressions relative to alternative means of external CPR, such as abdominal-only compressions. The absence of high-quality data precludes definitive recommendation of any particular form of CPR, in patients with LVADs. However, data identified suggest that chest compression is not as unsafe as previously thought. The efficacy of chest compressions in this patient population has not yet been investigated. Further research is required to address both the safety and efficacy of chest compressions in this population. Urgent presentation and publication of further evidence will inform future guidance.},

Concerns whether ECGs in medically compromised patients recorded in a sitting position should be considered "standard" tracings and whether ECGs recorded in the supine and standing positions and ECGs recorded in different positions in the Exercise Laboratory are interchangeable provided the impetus for this study. The ECG was recorded in the supine and standing positions in 10 patients using standard electrode placement and in the sitting, standing, and supine positions in 16 patients using the Mason-Likar electrode system. Comparisons of sums of P waves and QRS complexes of various combinations of ECG leads from recordings in different positions and amplitudes of Q, R, and S waves of all 12 ECG leads revealed stability in the standard and stress ECGs, although few statistically significant but minor changes were noted in some comparisons, which, however, could not be expected to have any diagnostic significance. Comparison of standard ECGs recorded in patients in the supine and standing positions and stress ECGs recorded in the sitting, standing, and supine positions are interchangeable; this should allay concerns about recording the standard ECG in unconventional positions and may facilitate and make more cost-effective ECG recording in busy outpatient clinic environments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Current guidelines recommend an immediate (eg, {\textless}10 minutes) 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. Yet, one third of all patients with myocardial infarction do not have chest pain. Our objective was to develop a practical approach to identify patients, especially those without chest pain, who require an immediate ECG in the ED to identify STEMI. Methods: An ECG prioritization rule was derived and validated using classification and regression tree analysis among {\textgreater}3 million ED visits to 107 EDs from 2007 to 2008. Results: The final study population included 3,575,178 ED patient visits; of these, 6,464 (0.18\%) were diagnosed with STEMI. Overall, 1,413 (21.9\%) of patients with STEMI did not present to the ED with chest pain. Major predictors of those requiring an immediate ECG in the ED included age ≥30 years with chest pain; age ≥50 years with shortness of breath, altered mental status, upper extremity pain, syncope, or generalized weakness; and those with age ≥80 years with abdominal pain or nausea/vomiting. When the ECG prioritization rule was applied to a validation sample, it had a sensitivity of 91.9\% (95\% CI 90.9\%-92.8\%) for STEMI and a negative predictive value 99.98\% (95\% CI 99.98\%-99.98\%). Conclusion: A simple ECG prioritization rule based on age and presenting symptoms in the ED can identify patients during triage who are at high risk for STEMI and therefore should receive an immediate 12-lead ECG, often before they are seen by a physician. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

In this paper, I re-examine previous studies of pecking and scaling effects in brain injury. I find that there are three keys to woodpeckers' ability to withstand high decelerations: their small size, which reduces the stress on the brain for a given acceleration; the short duration of the impact, which increases the tolerable acceleration; and the orientation of the brain within the skull, which increases the area of contact between the brain and the skull.},

When only precordial or only limb cables, excluding the neutral cable, have been interchanged the waveforms in the different leads are re-arranged, inverted, or unchanged, whereas the duration of intervals is not changed. The mistake can be recognized by the presence of unusual P-QRS patterns (e.g. negative P-QRS in lead I or II, positive in lead AVR, P-QRS complexes of opposite direction in leads I and V6, etc.), change in the P-QRS axis, or abnormal precordial QRS-T wave progression. Interchange of limb cables with the neutral cable distorts Wilson's terminal and the morphology of all precordial and unipolar limb leads. The telltale sign of the mistake is the presence of (almost) a flat line in lead I, II or III. Interchange of even one of the limb cables, except for the neutral cable, with a precordial cable distorts the morphology of most leads and leaves not more than one lead (I, II, or III) unchanged. Computerized algorithms for detection of lead misplacement, such as those based on artificial neural networks, or on correlation between original and reconstructed leads, have been developed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patient history and physical examination are widely accepted as cornerstones of diagnosis in modern medicine. We aimed to assess the value of individual historical and examination findings for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and predicting adverse cardiac events in undifferentiated Emergency Department (ED) patients with chest pain.

METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients presenting to the ED with suspected cardiac chest pain. Clinical features were recorded using a custom-designed report form. All patients were followed up for the diagnosis of AMI and the occurrence of adverse events (death, AMI or urgent revascularization) within 6 months.

RESULTS: AMI was diagnosed in 148 (18.6\%) of the 796 patients recruited. Following adjustment for age, sex and ECG changes, the following characteristics made AMI more likely (adjusted odds ratio, 95\% confidence intervals): pain radiating to the right arm (2.23, 1.24-4.00), both arms (2.69, 1.36-5.36), vomiting (3.50, 1.81-6.77), central chest pain (3.29, 1.94-5.61) and sweating observed (5.18, 3.02-8.86). Pain in the left anterior chest made AMI significantly less likely (0.25, 0.14-0.46). The presence of rest pain (0.67, 0.41-1.10) or pain radiating to the left arm (1.36, 0.89-2.09) did not significantly alter the probability of AMI.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results challenge many widely held assertions about the value of individual symptoms and signs in ED patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. Several 'atypical' symptoms actually render AMI more likely, whereas many 'typical' symptoms that are often considered to identify high-risk populations have no diagnostic value.},

Because prehospital predictors have not been defined, dispatchers, paramedics, and base station physicians continue to triage based on patient history. We reviewed 401 patients presenting in one year to an urban paramedic system with chest pain, normal vital signs, and stable rhythms to identify predictors of AMI and unstable angina. Thirty-one percent (123) had a diagnosis of AMI, 26\% (105) unstable angina, and 43\% (173) "other" diagnoses. Two-hundred seventy-eight patients required nitroglycerin administration, 182 required IV morphine, 14 developed arrhythmias requiring lidocaine, and two suffered cardiac arrest in the field. Nine other patients had a cardiac arrest after arrival in the ED. When comparing AMI and unstable angina patients to the "others," 64\% (132) versus 36\% (74) had radiation of pain (P less than .003), 72\% (95) versus 28\% (37) had diaphoresis (P less than .0001). Neither difficulty breathing, nausea/vomiting, vital signs, initial rhythm, nor past history of myocardial infarction were helpful in discriminating AMI and unstable angina from others. Comparing AMI alone versus others, the presence of ST segment elevation on lead II was present in 15\% (18) AMIs, 3\% (3) unstable angina, and 8\% (14) others (P = .005). Diaphoresis also was a predictor of diagnosis with 51\% (63) of the AMIs and 25\% (69) of others exhibiting this sign (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The most valuable items for making the diagnosis were classified according to their sensitivity, specificity and predictive value. Among the 278 patients, 100 individuals had myocardial infarctions (MI), 47 had unstable angina, 25 had stable angina and 106 patients had a non-coronary disease. The twelve most sensitive items for distinguishing MI from other conditions were the following: sudden onset of pain (70\%); duration of more than 60 min (88\%); constriction and squeezing (79\%); oppression (75\%); prior anginal attacks (61\%); sex male (72\%); age over 60 years (74\%); abnormal heart auscultation (62\%); abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) (98\%); segment (ST) disturbances (86\%); increased glucose level (77\%); CKMB fraction greater than 6\% of total creatine kinase (CK) level (63\%). Among the twelve most specific items, also with the best positive predictive value, irradiation in the right arm is of most importance; among the 51 patients with right arm involvement, 48 suffered from a coronary disease and 41 from a myocardial infarction. The largest extension of pain was reported in the latter group. It is concluded that chest pain with a wide irradiation involving the right arm strongly suggests that a myocardial infarction is ongoing.},

	abstract = {When faced with a patient with acute chest pain, clinicians must distinguish myocardial infarction (MI) from all other causes of acute chest pain. If MI is suspected, current therapeutic practice includes deciding whether to administer thrombolysis or primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and whether to admit patients to a coronary care unit. The former decision is based on electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, including ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block, the latter on the likelihood of the patient's having unstable high-risk ischemia or MI without ECG changes. Despite advances in investigative modalities, a focused history and physical examination followed by an ECG remain the key tools for the diagnosis of MI. The most powerful features that increase the probability of MI, and their associated likelihood ratios (LRs), are new ST-segment elevation (LR range, 5.7-53.9); new Q wave (LR range, 5.3-24.8); chest pain radiating to both the left and right arm simultaneously (LR, 7.1); presence of a third heart sound (LR, 3.2); and hypotension (LR, 3.1). The most powerful features that decrease the probability of MI are a normal ECG result (LR range, 0.1-0.3), pleuritic chest pain (LR, 0.2), chest pain reproduced by palpation (LR range, 0.2-0.4), sharp or stabbing chest pain (LR, 0.3), and positional chest pain (LR, 0.3).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To measure the predictive value and diagnostic performance of clinical features used to diagnose coronary syndromes in patients presenting with acute, undifferentiated chest pain.

METHODS: The clinical features of patients presenting to the authors' chest pain unit with acute, undifferentiated chest pain were prospectively recorded on a standard form. Admitted patients were followed up by case note review. Discharged patients were followed up as outpatients three days later. Six months after the emergency department visit, evidence of adverse events was searched for from the hospital computer database, case notes, and the patient's primary care physician. The authors tested the power of each feature to predict: 1) acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by World Health Organization criteria, and 2) any acute coronary syndrome (ACS), evidenced by cardiac testing, AMI, arrhythmia, death, or revascularization procedure within six months.

RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-three patients were assessed, 34 (3.8\%) with AMI and 81 (9.1\%) with ACS. Features useful in the diagnosis of AMI were exertional pain [likelihood ratio (LR) = 2.35], pain radiating to the shoulder or both arms (LR = 4.07), and chest wall tenderness (LR = 0.3). Features useful in the diagnosis of ACS were exertional pain (LR = 2.06) and pain radiating to the shoulder, the left arm, or both arms (LR = 1.62). The site or nature of pain and the presence of nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis were not predictive of AMI or ACS.

CONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist when clinical features are specifically investigated in patients with acute chest pain and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram. Clinical features have a limited role to play in triage decision making.},

Aim: To identify clinical features that independently predict ACS in patients with acute, undifferentiated chest pain.  Design: Prospective study of patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial.  Methods: The presenting characteristics of participants in the ESCAPE randomized trial of chest pain unit vs. routine care were recorded in a standardized manner. Follow-up consisted of troponin T measurement at 2 days, postal questionnaire at 1 month, and telephone contact at 6 months. ACS was defined as elevated troponin T at 2 days or major adverse cardiac event within 30 days of presentation. Multivariate analysis identified independent clinical predictors of ACS.  Results: ACS was diagnosed in 77 (7.9\%) of the 972 patients recruited. The following characteristics were independent predictors of ACS (odds ratio, p): age (1.09, p {\textless} 0.001), male gender (8.6, p {\textless} 0.001), indigestion or burning-type pain (3.0, p = 0.034), pain radiating to the left (2.4, p = 0.013) or right (5.7, p {\textless} 0.001) arm, vomiting (3.5, p = 0.007), and previous (5.1, p {\textless} 0.001) or current (3.7, p {\textless} 0.001) smoking.  Discussion: In addition to previously recognized predictors of ACS, it appears that indigestion or burning type pain predicts ACS in patients attending the emergency department with acute, undifferentiated chest pain.

	abstract = {Objectives. This study sought to determine the effect on transthoracic impedance of placement of defibrillation electrodes on the female breast versus adjacent to or under the breast. Background. Transthoracic impedance is a major determinant of transthoracic current flow in defibrillation. For a given energy setting, a high transthoracic impedance reduces current flow and may adversely affect the ability of electric shocks to accomplish defibrillation. We hypothesized that the increased interelectrode tissue associated with placement of the apex defibrillation electrode on the female breast would result in increased transthoracic impedance compared with electrode placement lateral to or under the breast. Method. Transthoracic impedance was measured noninvasively by passing a 5-V, 31.25-kHz square wave current through the chest and comparing the low level current flow to known references. We measured transthoracic impedance associated with three different apex defibrillation electrode positions - on the breast, under the breast and lateral to the breast - in 25 women (brassiere size 34A to 48C, 25 to 75 years old, body weight 128 to 328 lb [58 to 148 kg] and 2 men. The measurements were taken with a modified defibrillator that accurately predicts transthoracic impedance without delivering an actual shock. The measurement sequence was random. Results. The average measured transthoracic impedance with placement of the apex defibrillation electrode on the breast was 95 ?? 25 ohms (mean ?? SD), under the breast 84 ?? 17* ohms and lateral to the breast 83 ?? 20* ohms (asterisk indicates p {\textless} 0.01 vs. on the breast by analysis of variance). The study cohort was also classified into two groups: large breasted (brassiere size ???40) and small breasted (brassiere size ???39). The measured transthoracic impedances for the large-breasted group were 112 ?? 20 ohms for on the breast, 94 ?? 13* ohms for under the breast and 98 ?? 19* ohms for lateral to the breast. For the small breasted group, the similar transthoracic impedance measurements were 81 ?? 21, 77 ?? 16 and 71 ?? 13* ohms, respectively. Conclusions. In women, placement of the apex defibrillation electrode on the breast results in higher transthoracic impedance, which will reduce current flow. We recommend placing the apex electrode lateral to or underneath the breast.},

The average difference from the applied electrodes to the corresponding marked sites was 1.14 inches, ranging from a mean of 1.31 inches at lead V1 to 0.98 inches at lead V4. Overall, 64\% of precordial electrodes were placed within a radius of 1.25 inch, ranging from 56\% for lead V6 to 74\% for lead V4, and 27\% of precordial electrodes were placed within a radius of 0.625 inch. There was superior quadrant displacement of more than 0.625 inch in more than 50\% of routine applications of leads V1 and V2, indicating that these electrodes are commonly placed both high and wide of their anatomically defined precordial sites.

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the classification of hypovolaemic shock given by the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). Methods: Patients derived from the TraumaRegister DGU?? database between 2002 and 2010 were analyzed. First, patients were allocated into the four classes of hypovolaemic shock by matching the combination of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) according to ATLS. Second, patients were classified by only one parameter (HR, SBP or GCS) according to the ATLS classification and the corresponding changes of the remaining two parameters were assessed within these four groups. Analyses of demographic, injury and therapy characteristics were performed as well. Results: 36,504 patients were identified for further analysis. Only 3411 patients (9.3\%) could be adequately classified according to ATLS, whereas 33,093 did not match the combination of all three criteria given by ATLS. When patients were grouped by HR, there was only a slight reduction of SBP associated with tachycardia. The median GCS declined from 12 to 3. When grouped by SBP, GCS dropped from 13 to 3 while there was no relevant tachycardia observed in any group. Patients with a GCS=15 presented normotensive and with a HR of 88/min, whereas patients with a GCS{\textless}12 showed a slight reduced SBP of 117. mmHg and HR was unaltered.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about clinically important events and advanced care treatment that patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) encounter in the prehospital setting. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the proportion of community patients with STEMI who experienced a clinically important event or received advanced care treatment prior to arrival at a designated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) laboratory or emergency department (ED). METHODS: We reviewed 487 consecutive community patients with STEMI between May 2008 and June 2009. All patients were geographically within a single large "third-service" urban emergency medical services (EMS) system and were transported by paramedics with an advanced care scope of practice. We recorded predefined clinically important events and advanced care treatment that occurred in patients being transported directly to a PCI laboratory or ED (group 1) or interfacility transfer to a PCI laboratory (group 2). RESULTS: One or more clinically important events occurred in 92 of 342 (26.9\%) group 1 patients and nine of 145 (6.2\%) group 2 patients. The most common were sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Additionally, 33 of 342 (9.6\%) group 1 and nine of 145 (6.2\%) group 2 patients received one or more advanced care treatments. The most common were administration of morphine and administration of atropine. Eight group 1 patients and three group 2 patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or defibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important events and advanced care treatment are common in community STEMI patients undergoing prehospital transport or interfacility transfer to a PCI center. Several patients required CPR or defibrillation. Further research is needed to define the clinical experience of STEMI patients during the out-of-hospital phase and the scope of practice required of EMS providers to safely manage these patients.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From April 21, 2006, through August 12, 2012, we enrolled 2475 consecutive patients (796 women and 1679 men) presenting with acute chest pain to 9 emergency departments in a prospective multicenter study. The final diagnosis of AMI was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. INTERVENTIONS Treatment of AMI in the emergency department. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sex-specific diagnostic performance of 34 predefined and uniformly recorded CPCs in the early diagnosis of AMI. RESULTS Acute myocardial infarction was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 143 women (18.0\%) and 369 men (22.0\%). Although most CPCs were reported with similar frequency in women and men, several CPCs were reported more frequently in women (P \&lt; .05). The accuracy of most CPCs in the diagnosis of AMI was low in women and men, with likelihood ratios close to 1. Thirty-one of 34 CPCs (91.2\%) showed similar likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of AMI in women and men, and only 3 CPCs (8.8\%) seemed to have a sex-specific diagnostic performance with P \&lt; .05 for interaction. These CPCs were related to pain duration (2-30 and \&gt;30 minutes) and dynamics (decreasing pain intensity). However, because their likelihood ratios were close to 1, the 3 CPCs did not seem clinically helpful. Similar results were obtained when examining combinations of CPCs (all interactions, P ≥ .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Differences in the sex-specific diagnostic performance of CPCs are small and do not seem to support the use of women-specific CPCs in the early diagnosis of AMI.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Misplaced ECG electrodes can cause changes in ECG recordings, which could have an impact on clinical decisions. We aimed to determine the inter-rater reliability of ECG electrode placement by senior clinical staff in the ED. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in adult patients undergoing an ECG as part of their routine ED care. Adhesive electrodes were left in place after an ECG had been performed by the treating nurse, and subsequently each patient was assessed by two of the three investigators. Each investigator independently recorded the location of the chest electrodes relative to the recommended standard positions. Displacement of the electrodes from the standard positions was measured in the vertical and horizontal planes. The age, sex, weight, height and chest circumference was also recorded. Comparisons were made between investigators to determine variability in assessment of the standard positions. RESULTS: Measurement of horizontal and vertical displacement for each of the six chest leads in the 77 patients resulted in 924 paired measurements. There was substantial inter-rater variation in the measurement of both vertical (mean 13.5 mm, range 0-105 mm) and horizontal (mean 16.5 mm, range 0-120 mm) displacement. This variation was greater in the lateral chest leads and was more marked in women than in men, especially in the vertical plane (lead V6: men 14.5 mm vs women 27.0 mm, P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Among clinical 'experts', there is wide variation in the identification of the correct location for electrode placement, particularly in the lateral leads and in women. This has significant implications when comparing ECG in which electrodes have been placed by different clinicians.},

When performed after placement of the electrodes, the NV measurement does not in any way interfere with the recommended standardized electrode placement procedure.

	abstract = {Continuing uncertainty exists about standardized procedures for the placement of electrocardiographic (ECG) chest electrodes, technical variability being the largest error source for short-term variations in amplitudes and waveforms of the chest lead ECGs. To avoid presumed attenuation of ECG amplitudes by abundant breast tissue, anterolateral chest electrodes in women are often placed under the breasts and too low. There is also considerable uncertainty about locating the midclavicular line and the V4 electrode, particularly in obese persons and in women. We examined the effect of breast tissue protuberance on ECG amplitudes using ECG and anthropometric data on 6,814 women included in the Atherosclerosis Research in Communities Study (ARIC). The R wave amplitudes in anterolateral chest leads and the Sokolow-Lyon voltage decreased (P {\textless} .001 for all), and RaVL and the Cornell voltage increased significantly with increasing breast protuberance (P {\textless} .001 for all). However, these effects were small (15 ??V or less for each 1-cm increment in breast protuberance), and R2 values were less than .01, indicating that breast protuberance alone explained less than 1\% of ECG amplitude variations. When chest size and breast protuberance estimates were entered simultaneously into a multivariate regression model, chest size appeared to dominate, and model R2 values increased for positive associations with RaVL (R2 = .12) and the Cornell voltage (R2 = .04). Combined model R2 values remained ???.01 for all other ECG amplitudes. A detailed step-by-step standardized electrode placement procedure was formulated. Because of the difficulties encountered in locating the left midclavicular line by visual inspection, we introduced well-defined procedures for identification and documentation of lateral chest electrode placement locations as a quality control method for clinical trials. Population data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey on the distributions by sex and race of chest electrode V4 and V6 locations and anthropometric data on chest size and shape are presented in order to facilitate evaluation of the comparability of electrode placement procedures in various studies and for quality control in clinical trials. It is concluded that standardized procedures to document chest electrode placement locations are feasible. Breast tissue appears to have a practically negligible effect on ECG amplitudes, and in women, the placement of chest electrodes on the breast rather than under the breast is recommended in order to facilitate the precision of electrode placement at the correct horizontal level and at the correct lateral positions.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of electrocardiographic poor R-wave progression was estimated by reviewing all electrocardiograms recorded in Glasgow Royal Infirmary over a 2-week period. It was found to be higher in women (19\% vs. 11\%) than in men. To investigate one possible reason, the effect of chest electrode positioning in women was thereafter examined. Eighty four women were recruited to a study in which chest electrodes were placed strictly in adherence with recommendations of using the 4th and 5th intercostal spaces as references and also using the more widely adopted technique of placing electrodes V3 to V6 under the left breast. R wave amplitudes were compared in V3 to V6 from both sets of recordings. It was found that measurements recorded on the breast by electrode V3 have a significantly smaller R wave magnitude compared to corresponding measurements below the breast, the mean difference being 34 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of 7 to 60) microvolts. For V5 and V6, the reverse is true with measurements taken on the breast being larger, on average, than those taken below the breast by 119 (95\% CI of 87 to 152) and 134 (95\% CI of 108 to 160) microvolts respectively. For V4, there was no significant difference. Seventeen women with poor R wave progression suggestive of old anterior myocardial infarction had clinical data examined from which it was determined that 11 had a history suggestive of myocardial infarction, ie, the positive predictive value was 65\% (95\% CI of 42\% to 87\%). It was concluded that positioning of electrodes beneath rather than on top of the breast was not responsible for the increased prevalence of poor R wave progression in women and that the criterion of isolated poor R wave progression was too nonspecific to be of clinical value.},

As a separate study, 299 healthy women were recruited to study normal limits of leads V3 to V6 recorded with electrodes in the correct anatomical positions and compare them with published normal limits with electrodes in the more commonly used locations. Results: It was shown that there was less variability with electrodes in the correct anatomical positions and that there were significant differences between the new limits of normality compared with the old established limits.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The prospective, longitudinal Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, conducted at 127 hospitals in the United States and Spain, was designed, in part, to evaluate gender differences in baseline sexual activity, function, and patient experience with physician counseling about sexual activity after an AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N=2349) and men (N=1152) ages 18 to 55 years with AMI. Median age was 48 years. Among those who reported discussing sexual activity with a physician in the month after AMI (12\% of women, 19\% of men), 68\% were given restrictions: limit sex (35\%), take a more passive role (26\%), and/or keep the heart rate down (23\%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03-1.11), age (relative risk, 1.05 per 10 years; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08), and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.15). Among patients who received counseling, women in Spain were significantly more likely to be given restrictions than U.S. women (relative risk; 1.36, 95\% confidence interval, 1.11-1.66).

CONCLUSIONS: Very few patients reported counseling for sexual activity after AMI. Those who did were commonly given restrictions not supported by evidence or guidelines.

With each arterial blood gas sample, SpO2 from pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturations from CO-oximetry (SaO2) were simultaneously obtained if the SpO2 was ≤ 97\%.

RESULTS: The lowest SpO2 obtained in the study was 65\%. In the range of SpO2 65\% to 97\%, 1980 simultaneous values for SpO2 and SaO2 were obtained. The bias (SpO2 - SaO2) varied through the range of SpO2 values. The bias was greatest in the SpO2 range 81\% to 85\% (336 samples, median 6\%, mean 6.6\%, accuracy root mean squared 9.1\%). SpO2 measurements were close to SaO2 in the SpO2 range 91\% to 97\% (901 samples, median 1\%, mean 1.5\%, accuracy root mean squared 4.2\%).

CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies on pulse oximeter accuracy in children present a single number for bias. This study identified that the accuracy of pulse oximetry varies significantly as a function of the SpO2 range. Saturations measured by pulse oximetry on average overestimate SaO2 from CO-oximetry in the SpO2 range of 76\% to 90\%. Better pulse oximetry algorithms are needed for accurate assessment of children with saturations in the hypoxemic range.},

	abstract = {A number of ECG abnormalities can be observed in the acute phase of pulmonary embolism (PE). Their prognostic value has not yet been systematically studied in large patient populations. In 508 patients with acute major PE derived from a large prospective registry, the current authors assessed, on admission, the impact of specific pathological ECG findings on early (30-day) mortality. Atrial arrhythmias, complete right bundle branch block, peripheral low voltage, pseudoinfarction pattern (Q waves) in leads III and aVF, and ST segment changes (elevation or depression) over the left precordial leads, were all significantly more frequent in patients with a fatal outcome. Overall, 29\% of the patients who exhibited at least one of these abnormalities on admission did not survive to hospital discharge, as opposed to only 11\% of the patients without a pathological 12-lead ECG. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of at least one of the above ECG findings was, besides haemodynamic instability, syncope and pre-existing chronic pulmonary disease, a significant independent predictor of outcome. In conclusion, ECG may be a useful, simple, non-costly tool for initial risk stratification of patients with acute major pulmonary embolism.},

	abstract = {The benefit of emergency reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytics or primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation (STE) acute myocardial infarction (MI) is well known. However, what is not well known are which subgroups of MI patients with ST-segment depression (STD) on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) may benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy. Current clinical guidelines recommend against administering emergent reperfusion therapy to MI patients with STD on the ECG unless a true posterior MI is suspected. Overlooked subgroups of patients with STD on the initial ECG who may potentially benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy are patients with multilead STD with coexistent STE in lead aVR. This finding has been reported in MI patients with occlusion of the left main artery, occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, and MI in the presence of severe multivessel coronary artery disease. Because these patients have a higher mortality in the setting of MI, we believe that this ECG finding be considered a STEMI equivalent and that patients with this finding receive consideration for emergent reperfusion therapy preferably at a center with both primary percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting capability. In this report, we present 3 such patients to heighten the awareness of the emergency physician to this phenomenon. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {During the last few decades, acute ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in the proper clinical context has been a reliable surrogate marker of acute coronary occlusion requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). In 2004, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines specified ECG criteria that warrant immediate angiography in patients who are candidates for primary PPCI, but new findings have emerged that suggest a reappraisal is warranted. Furthermore, as part of integrated and efficient STEMI systems, emergency department and emergency medical services providers are now encouraged to routinely make the time-sensitive diagnosis of STEMI and promptly activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory (Cath Lab) team. Our primary objective is to provide a practical summary of updated ECG criteria for emergency coronary angiography with planned PPCI, thus allowing clinicians to maximize the rate of appropriate Cath Lab activation and minimize the rate of inappropriate Cath Lab activation. We review the evidence for ECG interpretation strategies that either increase diagnostic specificity for "classic" STEMI and left bundle-branch block or improve diagnostic sensitivity in identifying 4 STEMI-equivalents: posterior MI, acute left main occlusion, de Winter ST/T-wave complex, and certain scenarios of resuscitated cardiac arrest. ?? 2010 Mosby, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background. It is speculated, but unconfirmed, that the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia are less frequent and less pronounced in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in those with normal renal function. We studied 74 consecutively selected stable haemodialysis patients to determine the prevalence of electrocardiographic changes of hyperkalaemia in stable persons with ESRD receiving haemodialysis. Methods. Pre-dialysis serum potassium concentration and other electrolytes were measured and simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained. Results. The 74 study subjects (45 men, 29 women) comprised 63 blacks (85\%), four Hispanics (6\%), four whites (6\%), and three Asians (4\%) of mean\{+/-\}standard deviation age 55.5\{+/-\}14.7 years. Mean pre-dialysis potassium concentration was 4.9\{+/-\}0.71 mEq/l (range 3.3-6.7). No study subject evinced arrhythmia or any of the typical electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in T wave amplitude (F statistic=2.1; P=0.11) or T wave to R wave ratio (F statistic=2; P=0.12) between quartiles of serum potassium concentration. Also, T wave amplitude was equivalent in patients with serum potassium concentration {\textgreater}5.5 mEq/l (7.1\{+/-\}4.1 mm) or [{\textless}=]5.5 mEq/l (5.2\{+/-\}3.5 mm) (P=0.13). Linear regression analysis showed that the total serum calcium concentration had an inverse relation with T wave amplitude (P=0.03) after adjustment for other factors (a high total serum calcium concentration was associated with a low T wave amplitude). Conclusion. Haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia may not exhibit the usual electrocardiographic sequella of hyperkalaemia, possibly due in part to fluctuations in serum calcium concentration. Thus, the absence of electrocardiographic changes in hyperkalaemic haemodialysis patients should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {This article discusses state-of-the-art techniques for predicting risk of death after acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with special attention to how underlying malignancy adversely affects survival after an episode. Current methods of risk stratification generally categorize patients with PE as low-, moderate-, and high-risk for in-hospital adverse outcomes of respiratory failure, circulatory shock, and death. Published risk stratification studies find that patients with PE and an underlying malignancy have a worse prognosis, but no validated risk stratification criteria have been published specifically for these patients. Standard treatment is full-dose heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. The term escalated treatment refers to the use of systemic or intrapulmonary fibrinolytic agents, catheter-based treatment, or surgical embolectomy. Most patients with low-risk PE (normal vital signs and normal serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, and normal echocardiography) are treated successfully with standard anticoagulation, and many can be treated as outpatients. In contrast, patients with high-risk PE (systolic blood pressure {\textless} 90 mm Hg and no contraindications) often benefit from escalated treatment. Treatment decisions for patients with moderate-risk PE (normotension with evidence of right ventricular damage or dysfunction) are most controversial. Most patients in this category of risk recover with standard therapy, but some benefit from escalated treatment. Patients with cancer with an incidentally discovered PE should be risk stratified the same as those who have clinically suspected PE.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Negative T waves in precordial leads often occur in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but are also found in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). Because the clinical features of these two diseases mimic those of ACS, differential diagnosis is essential to select an appropriate treatment strategy improve outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the differences in negative T waves among ACS, APE and TC.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied admission ECGs in 300 patients (198 patients with ACS caused by the left anterior descending coronary artery disease, 81 with APE and 21 with TC). All patients were admitted within 48 h from symptom onset and had negative T waves ≥1.0 mm without ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V4. The number and maximal amplitude of negative T waves were greatest in patients with TC, followed by in those with ACS, and were lowest in patients with APE (p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The prevalence of negative T waves significantly differed in all 12 leads among the three groups (p {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Negative T waves in both leads III and V1 identified APE with 90\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. Negative T waves in lead -aVR (i.e., positive T waves in lead aVR) and no negative T waves in lead V1 identified TC with 95\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. These values represented the highest diagnostic accuracies.

CONCLUSION: The distributions of negative T waves differed among ACS, APE and TC, and these differences were useful for differentiating among these three diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare electrocardiography (ECG) parameters in patients with APE presenting with or without CS.

METHODS: A 12-lead ECG was recorded on admission at a paper speed of 25 mm/s and 10 mm/mV amplification. All ECGs were examined by a single cardiologist who was blinded to all other clinical data. All ECG measurements were made manually.

RESULTS: Electrocardiographic data from 500 patients with APE were analyzed, including 92 patients with CS. The following ECG parameters were associated with CS: S1Q3T3 sign, (odds ratio [OR]: 2.85, P{\textless}.001), qR or QR morphology of QRS in lead V1, (OR: 3.63, P{\textless}.001), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR: 2.46, P=.004), QRS fragmentation in lead V1 (OR: 2.94, P=.002), low QRS voltage (OR: 3.21, P{\textless}.001), negative T waves in leads V2 to V4 (OR: 1.81, P=.011), ST-segment depression in leads V4 to V6 (OR: 3.28, P{\textless}.001), ST-segment elevation in lead III (OR: 4.2, P{\textless}.001), ST-segment elevation in lead V1 (OR: 6.78, P{\textless}.01), and ST-segment elevation in lead aVR (OR: 4.35, P{\textless}.01). The multivariate analysis showed that low QRS voltage, RBBB, and ST-segment elevation in lead V1 remained statistically significant predictors of CS.

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with APE, low QRS voltage, RBBB, and ST-segment elevation in lead V1 were associated with CS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE), a major cause of morbidity and mortality, remains an elusive diagnosis. Recently investigators have found a new electrocardiographic (ECG) finding, simultaneous T-wave inversions in the anterior and inferior leads, which may distinguish PE from acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of this finding in PE. We also estimate the inter-rater reliability of this finding, its test characteristics, and assess ECG findings traditionally associated with PE.

METHODS: In this unmatched case-control study, we selected electrocardiograms from patients diagnosed with PE, ACS, and non-cardiac chest pain. Two emergency physicians, blinded to diagnoses, reviewed electrocardiograms for explicitly defined ECG findings. We calculated kappa (K) for inter-rater agreement and estimated prevalence differences (PD) for findings in the PE group vs. pooled control groups.

RESULTS: We included 97 patients with PE, 89 with ACS, and 105 with non-cardiac chest pain. A 1-mm T-wave inversion was seen in both III and V(1) in 11/97 (0.113) of patients with PE vs. 9/194 (0.046) controls (PD 0.07 [95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.01-+0.14]; K = 0.7). Other criteria for anterior and inferior T-wave inversions were less common in PE (0.04-0.05). Among several other ECG abnormalities tested, only sinus tachycardia (PD 0.20 [95\% CI 0.09-0.31]; K = 0.7) and the classic S(I)Q(III)T(III) pattern (PD 0.05 [95\% CI -0.01-+0.11]; K = 0.5) statistically distinguished PE and were noted with fair or better inter-rater agreement.

CONCLUSION: In our study, simultaneous T-wave inversions in anterior and inferior leads were associated with PE but are seen in only 4-11\% of cases.},

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the relationship between pre-hospital use of epinephrine and functional survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who achieved successful ROSC.

METHODS: We included all patients with OHCA who achieved successful ROSC admitted to a cardiac arrest center from January 2000 to August 2012. Use of epinephrine was coded as yes/no and by dose (none, 1 mg, 2 to 5 mg, {\textgreater}5 mg). A favorable discharge outcome was coded using a Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2. Analyses incorporated multivariable logistic regression, propensity scoring, and matching methods.

RESULTS: Of the 1,556 eligible patients, 1,134 (73\%) received epinephrine; 194 (17\%) of these patients had a good outcome versus 255 of 422 patients (63\%) in the nontreated group (p {\textless} 0.001). This adverse association of epinephrine was observed regardless of length of resuscitation or in-hospital interventions performed. Compared with patients who did not receive epinephrine, the adjusted odds ratio of intact survival was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.84) for 1 mg of epinephrine, 0.30 (95\% CI: 0.20 to 0.47) for 2 to 5 mg of epinephrine, and 0.23 (95\% CI: 0.14 to 0.37) for {\textgreater}5 mg of epinephrine. Delayed administration of epinephrine was associated with worse outcome.

CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients who achieved ROSC, pre-hospital use of epinephrine was consistently associated with a lower chance of survival, an association that showed a dose effect and persisted despite post-resuscitation interventions. These findings suggest that additional studies to determine if and how epinephrine may provide long-term functional survival benefit are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: The basic life support (BLS) termination of resuscitation (TOR) rule recommends transport and continued resuscitation when cardiac arrest is witnessed by EMT-Ds, or there is a return of spontaneous circulation, or a shock is given, and prior studies have suggested the transport rate should fall to 37\%. Methods and results: This real-time prospective multi-center implementation trial evaluated the BLS TOR rule for compliance, transport rate and provider and physician comfort. Both provider and physician noted their decision-making rationale and ranked their comfort on a 5-point Likert scale. Functional survival was measured at discharge. Of 2421 cardiac arrests, 953 patients were eligible for the rule, which was applied correctly for 755 patients (79\%) of which 388 were terminated. 565 patients were transported resulting in a reduction of the transport rate from 100\% (historical control) to 59\% (p{\textless} 0.001). The BLS TOR rule was not followed in 198 eligible patients (21\%) and they were all transported despite meeting the criteria to terminate. Providers cited 241 reasons for non-compliance: family distress, short transport time interval, younger age and public venue. All 198 transported patients, non-compliant with the rule, died. Both providers and physicians were comfortable with using the rule to guide TOR (median [IQR] of 5 [4,5]; p{\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: This implementation trial confirmed the accuracy of the BLS TOR rule in identifying futile out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitations, significantly reduced the transport rate of futile OHCA and most providers and physicians were comfortable following the rule's recommendations. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The primary aims of this study were to compare paramedic success rates and complications of two different video laryngoscopes in a prehospital clinical study. METHODS: This study was a multi-agency, prospective, non-randomized, cross over clinical trial involving paramedics from four different EMS agencies. Following completion of training sessions, six Storz CMAC™ video laryngoscopes and six King Vision™ (KV) video laryngoscopes were divided between agencies and placed into service for 6 months. Paramedics were instructed to use the video laryngoscope for all patients estimated to be ≥ 18 years old who required advanced airway management per standard operating procedure. After 6 months, the devices were crossed over for the final 6 months of the study period. Data collection was completed using a telephone data collection system with a member of the research team (available 24/7). First attempt success, overall success, and success by attempt, were compared between treatment groups using exact logistic regression adjusted for call type and user experience. RESULTS: Over a 12-month period, 107 patients (66 CMAC, 41 KV) were treated with a study device. The CMAC had a significantly higher likelihood of first attempt success (OR = 1.85; 95\% CI 0.74, 4.62; p = 0.188), overall success (OR = 7.37; 95\% CI 1.73, 11.1; p = 0.002), and success by attempt (OR = 3.38; 95\% CI 1.67, 6.8; p = 0.007) compared to KV. Providers reverted to direct laryngoscopy in 80\% (27/34) of the video laryngoscope failure cases, with the remaining patients having their airways successfully managed with a supraglottic airway in 3 cases and bag-valve mask in 4 cases. The provider-reported complications were similar and none were statistically different between treatment groups. Complication rates were not statistically different between devices. CONCLUSION: The CMAC had a higher likelihood of successful intubation compared to the King Vision. Complication rates were not statistically different between groups. Video laryngoscope placement success rates were not higher than our historical direct laryngoscopy success rates.},

	abstract = {Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in Australia. The most common cause of OHCA is a heart attack. The current treatment of OHCA is resuscitation by ambulance paramedics involving CPR, electrical shocks to the heart, and injections of adrenaline. In more than 50\% of cases, paramedics are unable to start the heart and the patient is declared dead at the scene. Patients with OHCA who do not respond to paramedic resuscitation are not routinely transported to hospital because it is hazardous for paramedics to undertake rapid transport whilst administering chest compressions and there is currently no additional therapy available at the hospital that would assist in starting the heart. However, a number of recent developments suggest that there may be a new approach to the resuscitation of this group of patients who would otherwise die. Firstly, Ambulance Victoria have recently introduced portable battery powered machines that allow chest compressions to be safely and effectively delivered during emergency ambulance transport. Second, The Alfred ICU will shortly be implementing a new protocol whereby the patient in cardiac arrest can immediately be placed on a heart-lung machine. This is known as extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Third, the brain can now be much better protected against damage due to lack of blood flow using therapeutic hypothermia which is the controlled lowering of body temperature from 37°C to 33°C. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this significantly decreases brain damage after OHCA. Finally, The Alfred Cardiology service has an emergency service for reopening the blocked artery of the heart in patients who present with a sudden blockage of the heart arteries. This is currently not used in patients without a heart beat because of the technical difficulty of undertaking this procedure with chest compressions being undertaken. This study proposes for the first time to implement all the above interventions when patients have failed standard resuscitation after OHCA. When standard resuscitation has proved futile, the patient will be transported to The Alfred with the mechanical chest compression device, cooled to 33°C, placed on ECMO, and then transported to the interventional cardiac catheter laboratory. The patient will then receive therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours. Subsequent management will follow the standard treatment guidelines of The Alfred Intensive Care Unit.},

The objective of this study was to determine if endotracheal intubation procedures are more likely to occur at greater distances from the hospital and near clusters of pediatric calls. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study including all EMS runs for patients less than 18 years of age from 2008 to 2014 in a geographically large and diverse Oregon county that includes densely populated urban areas near Portland and remote rural areas. We geocoded scene addresses using the automated address locator created in the cloud-based mapping platform ArcGIS, supplemented with manual address geocoding for remaining cases. We then use the Getis-Ord Gi spatial statistic feature in ArcGIS to map statistically significant spatial clusters (hot spots) of pediatric EMS runs throughout the county. We then superimposed all intubation procedures performed during the study period on maps of pediatric EMS-run hot spots, pediatric population density, fire stations, and hospitals. We also performed multivariable logistic regression to determine if distance traveled to the hospital was associated with intubation after controlling for several confounding variables. RESULTS We identified a total of 7,797 pediatric EMS runs during the study period and 38 endotracheal intubations. In univariate analysis we found that patients who were intubated were similar to those who were not in gender and whether or not they were transported to a children's hospital. Intubated patients tended to be transported shorter distances and were older than non-intubated patients. Increased distance from the hospital was associated with reduced odds of intubation after controlling for age, sex, scene location, and trauma system entry status in a multivariate logistic regression. The locations of intubations were superimposed on hot spots of all pediatric EMS runs. This map demonstrates that most of the intubations occurred within areas where pediatric EMS calls were highly clustered. By mapping the intubation procedures and pediatric population density, we found that intubation procedures were not clustered in a similar distribution to the pediatric population in the county. CONCLUSION In this geographically diverse county the location of intubation procedures was similar to the clustering of pediatric EMS calls, and increased distance from the hospital was associated with reduced odds of intubation after controlling for several potential confounding variables.},

We examine first-look success in emergency pediatric intubation by a physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical service (EMS). 

METHODS
A database analysis of all pediatric ({\textless}16 years) intubations during a 64-month period was undertaken, using data from a prospectively enrolled electronic airway registry form. Recorded findings included patient demographics, operator background, airway intervention including intubation attempts, complications, and critical timings. 

RESULTS
Eighty-two subjects were identified during the 64-month study. All patients were successfully intubated. The overall first-look success rate was 75 of 82 (91\%), registrars achieving a first-look success rate of 26 of 26 (100\%), consultants 16 of 17 (94\%), and paramedics 33 of 39 (85\%). Overall complication rate was 14\%; 84\% of cases were rapid sequence induction, whereas 16\% were “cold intubations.” Difficult airway indicators were present in 77\% of patients. 

CONCLUSION
A high first-look success rate for pediatric intubation was achieved by adult helicopter EMS physicians and intensive care paramedics. To our knowledge, this compares favorably with the rate in published literature in pediatric emergency departments and critical care units.},

The physician must dissect the ECG for elusive, but perilous, characteristics that are often missed by machine analysis. ST depression is interpreted and often suggestive of ischemia; however, when exclusive to leads V1-V3 with concomitant tall R waves and upright T waves, a posterior infarction should first and foremost be suspected. Likewise, diffuse ST depression with elevation in aVR should raise concern for left main- or triple-vessel disease and, as with the aforementioned, these ECG findings are grounds for acute reperfusion therapy. Even in isolation, certain electrocardiographic findings can suggest danger. Such is true of the lone T-wave inversion in aVL, known to precede an inferior myocardial infarction. Similarly, something as ordinary as an upright and tall T wave or a biphasic T wave can be the only marker of ischemia. ECG abnormalities, however subtle, should give pause and merit careful inspection since misinterpretation occurs in 20-40\% of misdiagnosed myocardial infarctions.},

METHODS A prospective, randomised, multicentre study was conducted over one year with LUCAS 2 devices in 14 ambulances and manual CPR in 32 ambulances to manage OHCA. The primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes were survival at 24 hours, discharge from hospital and 30 days. RESULTS Of the 1,274 patients recruited, 1,191 were eligible for analysis. 889 had manual CPR and 302 had LUCAS CPR. From an ITT perspective, outcomes for manual and LUCAS CPR were: ROSC 29.2\% and 31.1\% (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95\% confi dence interval [CI] 0.82–1.45; p = 0.537); 24-hour survival 11.2\% and 13.2\% (OR 1.20, 95\% CI 0.81–1.78; p = 0.352); survival to discharge 3.6\% and 4.3\% (OR 1.20, 95\% CI 0.62–2.33; p = 0.579); and 30-day survival 3.0\% and 4.0\% (OR 1.32, 95\% CI 0.66–2.64; p = 0.430), respectively. By as-treated analysis, outcomes for manual, early LUCAS and late LUCAS CPR were: ROSC 28.0\%, 36.9\% and 24.5\%; 24-hour survival 10.6\%, 15.5\% and 8.2\%; survival to discharge 2.9\%, 5.8\% and 2.0\%; and 30-day survival 2.4\%, 5.8\% and 0.0\%, respectively. Adjusted OR for survival with early LUCAS vs. manual CPR was 1.47 after adjustment for other variables (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION This study showed a survival benefi t with LUCAS CPR as compared to manual CPR only, when the device was applied early on-site.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with inferior STEMI involving the right ventricle are believed to be at higher risk for hypotension after nitroglycerin (NTG). The objective of this study was to determine if inferior STEMI is associated with increased risk of hypotension upon ED arrival in patients treated with NTG by EMS. Methods: Consecutive adult patients with suspected STEMI transported by EMS to one of three participating PCI-capable hospitals were prospectively identified and maintained in a log during an 18-month period. Investigators reviewed records for initial field and ED vital signs, field NTG treatment, and hospital outcomes. Inter-rater reliability was assessed on a random 10\% sample of records using the kappa statistic. Patients with a hospital diagnosis of STEMI treated with NTG were included. Patients with hypotension on EMS arrival were excluded. Inferior STEMI was defined as ST-elevations in the inferior leads on the prehospital ECG. The frequency of ED hypotension, defined as a triage SBP less than 100 mmHg, in patients with inferior STEMI was compared to patients with other STEMI. Patients were further stratified by lesion location. The frequency of hypotension was compared with Fisher's exact test and change in SBP with Hodges-Lehmann's median difference. Results: Of 239 patients with STEMI, 46 were excluded for initial hypotension and 38 did not receive NTG; thus, 155 comprised the study cohort. Median age was 61 years; 71\% male. Hypotension occurred in 10 (14\%) with inferior STEMI and 3 (4\%) with other STEMI, RR 1.13 (95\%CI 1.00, 1.23) p = 0.04. Hypotension was mild; one patient with inferior STEMI arrived with SBP {\textless}90 mmHg due to cardiac arrest. Inter-rater reliability was excellent, kappa 0.93 (95\% CI 0.80, 1.0). Mean decrease in SBP was −15 ± 23 mmHg and −10 ± 22 mmHg in inferior and other STEMI, respectively, median difference in the decrease in SBP −4.5 mmHg (95\% CI −12.0, 3.0). Compared to patients treated with PCI in any other location, hypotension after NTG among patients with proximal or mid RCA lesions was similar, RR 1.0 (95\%CI 0.9, 1.1) p = 0.6. Conclusions: When compared with other STEMI patients, those with inferior STEMI had a slightly higher risk of mild hypotension after field NTG; RCA lesion location was not associated with an increased risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Strategies to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) and improve cerebral/systemic perfusion during CPR have become a recent focus for resuscitation researchers. One experimental method to lower ICP has been to elevate the head/chest during CPR combined with the use of devices to enhance venous return to the thorax. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both the safety and clinical feasibility of such a bundled technique that includes mechanical CPR devices used at an angle. Methods: The EMS system catchment (pop. 1.4 million) is geographically expansive with broad ethnic diversity, extremes of age and socioeconomics and low frequency of bystander CPR. Through an established Utstein-style registry, all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) cases (all rhythms) were followed over 3.5 years (January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2017; n=2,285). EMS crews were previously using the Lucas© device and impedance threshold device (ITD), but, after April 1, 2015, they also: (1) applied O2 while deferring positive-pressure ventilation and ITD application several minutes; (2) raised the backboard ∼20° (head/torso-up) following ITD application; and (3) solidified a pit-crew approach for device application. With neuro-intact discharge data not available until 2015, “short-term” survival (sustained resuscitation by EMS to hospital admission) was used for consistent comparisons. Quarterly reports were run to identify any periodic variations or incremental effects during protocol transition (in Quarter 2, 2015). Results: There were no complications/difficulties in using the head/torso-up position (n = 1,319). Of 806 consecutive OOHCA cases attended between January 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015, quarterly (all-rhythm) survival rates remained constant (mean 17.87\%, range 15–20\%) but rose steadily during the transition period with an ensuing sustained doubling (35.18\%; range 30–40\%) for the next two years (July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2017). Outcomes improved across subgroups while response intervals, indications for initiating CPR and bystander CPR rates were unchanged. EMS resuscitation rates in 2016 and 2017 were found to be proportional to neuro-intact discharge. Conclusions: The head-up/torso-up CPR bundle was not only feasible, but was associated with an immediate, steady rise in EMS resuscitation rates during the transition phase with a subsequent sustained doubling of survival chances, making a compelling case that this bundled technique may improve OOHCA outcomes in future clinical trials.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Repeated or serial 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) in the prehospital setting may improve management of patients with subtle ST-segment elevation (STE) or with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that evolves over time. However, there is a minimal amount of scientific evidence available to support the clinical utility of this method. Our objective was to evaluate the use of serial 12-lead ECGs to detect STEMI in patients during transport in a Canadian emergency medical services (EMS) jurisdiction. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of suspected STEMI patients transported by EMS in the Chaudière-Appalaches region (Québec, Canada) between August 2006 and December 2013. Patients were monitored by a serial 12-lead ECG system where an averaged ECG was transmitted every 2 minutes. Following review by an emergency physician, ECGs were grouped as having either a persistent STE or a dynamic STE that evolved over time. RESULTS A total of 754 suspected STEMI patients were transported by EMS during the study period. Of these, 728 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. A persistent STE was observed in 84.3\% (614/728) of patients, while the remaining 15.7\% (114/728) had a dynamic STE. Among those with dynamic STE, 11.1\% (81/728) had 1 ST-segment change (41 no-STEMI to STEMI; 40 STEMI to no-STEMI) and 4.5\% (33/728) had ≥ 2 ST-segment changes (17 no-STEMI to STEMI; 16 STEMI to no-STEMI). Overall, in 8.0\% (58/728) of the cohort, STEMI was identified on a subsequent ECG following an initial no-STEMI ECG. CONCLUSIONS Through recognition of transient ST-segment changes during transport via the prehospital serial 12-lead ECG system, STEMI was identified in 8\% of suspected STEMI patients who had an initial no-STEMI ECG.

	abstract = {Background: Prehospital identification of STEMI allows decreased time to PCI. False positive prehospital STEMI Alerts may waste resources through unnecessary cath lab activation as well as pose risks to patients. Our current prehospital STEMI Alert Criteria includes ST-segment elevation {\textgreater}1mm in two or more contiguous leads and/or presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the presence of anginal symptoms. LBBB was removed from STEMI criteria in the most recent AHA/ACC STEMI guidelines as a result of low specificity. We hypothesize that LBBB has led to a high number of false positive activations in our system and can safely be removed from our STEMI criteria. Methods: We conducted a one-year retrospective analysis of prehospital STEMI alerts. Hospital records were reviewed for ED physician interpretation of EKG findings of ST-elevation, LBBB, or neither of these criteria (nondiagnostic). Primary outcomes were cath lab activation and intervention. Secondary outcomes analyzed were presence of initial elevated troponin. We excluded patients with missing records. Results: A total of 107 STEMI Alerts were transported over the study period, with records available for 102 patients. Of patients identified as EMS STEMI Alerts, 45.1\% went to cath, and 36.3\% received coronary intervention. Rates of cath lab activation and coronary intervention were significantly higher in patients with an ED physician interpretation of ST-elevation compared to those with LBBB (71\% vs. 9\%, OR 22.03, CI 9.77–49.68, p {\textless} 0.0001). One patient with LBBB received emergent cath with stenting after testing revealed elevated troponin. Secondary analysis of this patient's EKG showed that he did not have Sgarbossa criteria. Conclusions: The majority of EMS STEMI alerts did not require emergent cardiac catheterization. More false positive alerts were due to nondiagnostic EKGs rather than LBBB. It appears that removal of LBBB as criteria for STEMI activation can safely lower STEMI alert numbers. Future protocols will direct EMS to transport patients with LBBB and anginal symptoms to a PCI-capable center without designating the patient as a STEMI alert. Further efforts will be aimed at decreasing the number of false positive alerts through EMS education.},

	abstract = {Background: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals rely on the bag-valve-mask (BVM) to provide life-saving positive pressure ventilation in the prehospital setting. Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. A recent study has shown that the volumes typically delivered by EMS professionals with the adult BVM are often higher than recommended by lung-protective ventilation protocols. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could reduce the volume delivered by adjusting the way the BVM was held. Secondary objectives included (1) if the adjusted grip allowed for volumes more consistent with lung-protection ventilation strategies and (2) comparing volumes to similar grip strategies used with a smaller BVM. Methods: A patient simulator of a head and thorax was used to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume delivered by participants for 1 minute each across six different scenarios: three different grips (using the thumb and either three fingers, two fingers, or one finger) with two different sized BVMs (adult and pediatric). Trials were randomized by blindly selecting a paper with the scenario listed. A convenience sample of EMS providers was used based on EMS provider and research staff availability. Results: We enrolled 50 providers from a large, busy, urban hospital-based EMS agency a mean 8.60 (SD = 9.76) years of experience. Median volumes for each scenario were 836.0mL, 834.5mL, 794mL for the adult BMV (p = 0.003) and 576.0mL, 571.5mL, 547.0mL for the pediatric BVM (p {\textless} 0.001). Across all three grips, the pediatric BVM provided more breaths within the recommended volume range for a 70kg patient (46.4\% vs 0.4\%; p {\textless} 0.001) with only a 1.1\% of breaths below the recommended tidal volume. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to alter the volume provided by the BVM by altering the grip on the BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Guidelines recommend treating patients with a new or presumed new left bundle-branch block (LBBB) similar to those with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. It is often unclear which emergency department (ED) patients with potentially ischemic symptoms actually have an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), even in the setting of LBBB. Our null hypothesis was that in ED patients with potential AMI, the presence of a new or presumed new LBBB would not predict an increased likelihood of AMI. 

METHODS
This was an observational cohort study. Patients older than 30 years who presented with chest pain or other ischemic equivalent and had an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were enrolled. Data collected include demographics, history, ECG, and cardiac markers. Electrocardiograms were classified according to the standardized guidelines, including LBBB not known to be old (new or presumed new LBBB), LBBB known to be old, or no LBBB. The hospital course was followed, and 30-day follow-up was performed on all patients. Our main outcome was AMI. 

RESULTS
There were 7937 visits (mean age, 54.3 ± 15 years, 57\% female, 68\% black): 55 had new or presumed new LBBB, 136 had old LBBB, and 7746 had no LBBB. The rate of AMI was not significantly different between the 3 groups (7.3\% vs 5.2\% vs 6.1\%; P = .75). Revascularization (7.8\% vs old 5.2\% vs 4.3\%; P = .04) and coronary artery disease were more common in patients with new or presumed new LBBB (19.2\% vs 11.9\% vs 10.1\%; P = .0004). 

CONCLUSIONS
Despite guideline recommendations that patients with potential ACS and new or presumed new LBBB should be treated similar to STEMI, ED patients with a new or presumed new LBBB are not at increased risk of AMI. In fact, the presence of LBBB, whether new or old, did not predict AMI. Caution should be used in applying recommendations derived from patients with definite AMI to ED patients with potential ACS that may or may not be sustaining an AMI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of acute traumatic pain is a crucial component of prehospital care and yet the assessment and administration of analgesia is highly variable, frequently suboptimal, and often determined by consensus-based regional protocols. OBJECTIVE: To develop an evidence-based guideline (EBG) for the clinical management of acute traumatic pain in adults and children by advanced life support (ALS) providers in the prehospital setting. Methods. We recruited a multi-stakeholder panel with expertise in acute pain management, guideline development, health informatics, and emergency medical services (EMS) outcomes research. Representatives of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (sponsoring agency) and a major children's research center (investigative team) also contributed to the process. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to guide the process of question formulation, evidence retrieval, appraisal/synthesis, and formulation of recommendations. The process also adhered to the National Prehospital Evidence-Based Guideline (EBG) model process approved by the Federal Interagency Council for EMS and the National EMS Advisory Council. RESULTS: Four strong and three weak recommendations emerged from the process; two of the strong recommendations were linked to high- and moderate-quality evidence, respectively. The panel recommended that all patients be considered candidates for analgesia, regardless of transport interval, and that opioid medications should be considered for patients in moderate to severe pain. The panel also recommended that all patients should be reassessed at frequent intervals using a standardized pain scale and that patients should be re-dosed if pain persists. The panel suggested the use of specific age-appropriate pain scales. CONCLUSION: GRADE methodology was used to develop an evidence-based guideline for prehospital analgesia in trauma. The panel issued four strong recommendations regarding patient assessment and narcotic medication dosing. Future research should define optimal approaches for implementation of the guideline as well as the impact of the protocol on safety and effectiveness metrics.},

SUMMARY Mechanical chest compression devices have been developed to better deliver uninterrupted chest compressions of good quality. Prospective large randomized studies have not been able to prove a better outcome compared to manual chest compressions; however, latest guidelines support their use when high-quality manual chest compressions cannot be delivered. Mechanical chest compressions can also be preferred during transportation, in the cath-lab and as a bridge to more invasive support like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Guidelines advise that a prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained in any patients with chest pain, yet up to 20\% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) do not present with chest pain. The objective was to determine the association of atypical presentations in the prehospital setting on the likelihood of receiving a prehospital ECG and subsequent time to reperfusion therapy. METHODS: This study used a data set that linked prehospital medical information from a statewide EMS data system with a clinical registry of treatment and outcomes data for patients with STEMI. Among 2,639 STEMI patients from 2008 to 2010, the association between non-chest pain presentations, prehospital ECG use, and reperfusion times among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were examined. Inverse probability weights were used to account for observed baseline confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 318 of 2,639 patients (12.1\%) presented without chest pain. A prehospital ECG was obtained in 2,021 of 2,321 (87.1\%) patients with chest pain compared with only 230 of 318 (72.3\%) without chest pain (odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69 to 2.98). Among patients without chest pain, those who received a prehospital ECG had significantly shorter first medical contact (FMC) to device times (30.9\% {\textless} 90 minutes vs. 11.4\% {\textgreater} 90 minutes, adjusted OR = 2.81, 95\% CI = 1.29 to 6.11, p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Over one-quarter of STEMI patients presenting without chest pain did not receive prehospital ECGs and had significantly longer FMC to device times. Future efforts are needed to promote the use of prehospital ECGs to achieve more rapid identification of STEMI patients with atypical presentations in the prehospital setting.},

Physicians reviewed the prehospital ECG to determine whether there were any clinically significant abnormalities present on the prehospital ECG not captured on the initial ED ECG.

Thirty-five (12.5\%; 95\% CI: 9.1\%, 16.8\%) prehospital ECGs showed changes that were not captured on the initial ED ECG (11 ST depression, 5 T-wave inversion [TWI], 2 ST depression and TWI, 12 arrhythmia, 2 arrhythmia with ST depression, 2 ST elevation, 1 unknown). Fifty-two (18.5\%; 95\% CI: 14.4\%, 23.5\%) prehospital ECGs influenced physician management. There were 30 (10.7\%) instances where physicians were willing to refer the patient to an inpatient service based on information captured on the prehospital ECG, regardless if the initial ED ECG was normal.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECGs show clinically significant abnormalities that are not always captured on the initial ED ECG.

	abstract = {Currently, only single-lead, serial telemetry rhythm strips can be transmitted from ambulances. Triage of patients with chest pain and administration of thrombolytic therapy in ambulances is limited by the lack of specific electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis. A new technique is described using cellular telephone transmission of simultaneous 12-lead ECGs from ambulance to hospital to overcome this limitation. A portable 12-lead ECG installed in an ambulance was connected via modern link to a cellular telephone and digitized ECG information was transmitted to an ECG device in the hospital emergency room. Paramedics in the field placed adhesive patch electrodes and attached ECG wires. Field ECGs from 23 patients were compared with corresponding transmitted ECGs. There were no differences in heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval or R- and T-wave axes. Baseline and transmitted ECGs had identical morphologic characteristics. Differences in R-wave amplitude in 5 transmitted tracings compared with hospital-recorded ECGs resulted in computer diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, possibly due to differences in patient position. Twelve-lead ECGs can be easily transmitted from a moving ambulance using cellular telephones. This allows diagnosis before hospital arrival, improves prehospital triage of patients and may facilitate prehospital therapy with lidocaine or streptokinase. In addition, the cellular telephone link can convey both verbal and digitized information and thus improve on current telemetry systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Safe and effective patient care for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) relies on prompt emergency medical service (EMS) and established care coordination with receiving hospitals to conduct primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Likewise, a new emphasis has been placed on first medical contact-to-balloon (E2B) times as opposed to door-to-balloon times, identifying prehospital care as an important contributing factor for high-quality STEMI care. Therefore, we evaluated EMS processes of care before and after a period of continuous quality improvement to improve E2B times in our rural tertiary care medical center.

METHODS: A retrospective, consecutive cohort study was conducted on 177 patients who received primary PCI at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a rural hospital, from January 1, 2006 to October 31, 2009. This cohort was stratified from January 1, 2008 to May 1, 2008 (n = 88) and May 1, 2008 to October 31, 2009 (n = 89), to acknowledge periods of no improvement (pre) and continuous quality improvement (post) in STEMI care. Primary outcome measures included frequency of non-PCI-capable hospital bypass, E2B, and frequency of prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation. Descriptive statistics and log-rank tests were used to determine whether measures differed significantly by time period. A time-to-event analysis was conducted using a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the impact of outcomes measures on E2B pre/post-May 1, 2008.

RESULTS: Patients who presented before May 1, 2008 had longer E2B times compared with patients in the post-May 1, 2008 cohort (145.1 minutes vs 115.2 minutes, t test P = .01). A log-rank test confirmed this (pre: 130 minutes vs post: 106 minutes, χ(2) = 5.3, log-rank P = .02). Similarly, patients who presented before May 1, 2008 had lower percentages of prehospital ECGs (49\% vs 80\%, P = .001) and CCL activations (4\% vs 32\%, P {\textless} .001). When prehospital ECGs (140 minutes vs 106 minutes, χ(2) = 5.9, log-rank P = .01) or CCL activations (125 minutes vs 98 minutes, χ(2) = 4.2, log-rank P = .04) were conducted, E2B times were significantly reduced. Patients who received both prehospital ECGs and prehospital CCL activations had significantly reduced E2B times compared with those who did not (125 minutes vs 91 minutes, χ(2) = 4.8, P = .02).

CONCLUSIONS: The time saving benefits of prehospital ECGs may not be fully realized unless prehospital CCL activations also occur. EMS providers achieved further reductions in median E2B of approximately 24 minutes when prehospital ECGs were combined with prehospital CCL activation. Every effort should be made by PCI-capable medical centers to assess prehospital STEMI care and to integrate EMS providers into regional STEMI care quality improvement initiatives and education.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Reducing door-to-balloon times for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients has been shown to improve long-term survival. We aim to reduce door-to-balloon time for STEMI patients requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention by adoption of out-of-hospital 12-lead ECG transmission by Singapore's national ambulance service.

METHODS: This was a nationwide, before-after study of STEMI patients who presented to the emergency departments (ED) and required percutaneous coronary intervention. In the before phase, chest pain patients received 12-lead ECGs in the ED. In the after phase, 12-lead ECGs were performed by ambulance crews and transmitted from the field to the ED. Patients whose ECG showed greater than or equal to 2 mm ST-segment elevation in anterior or greater than or equal to 1 mm ST-segment elevation in inferior leads for 2 or more contiguous leads and symptom onset of less than 12 hours' duration were eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention activation before arrival.

RESULTS: ECGs (2,653) were transmitted by the ambulance service; 180 (7\%) were suspected STEMI. One hundred twenty-seven patients from the before and 156 from the after phase met inclusion criteria for analysis. Median door-to-balloon time was 75 minutes in the before and 51 minutes in the after phase (median difference=23 minutes; 95\% confidence interval 18 to 27 minutes). Median door-to-balloon times were significantly reduced regardless of presentation hours. Overall, there was significant reduction in door-to-activation, door-to-ECG, and door-to-cardiovascular laboratory times. No significant difference was found pertaining to adverse events.

CONCLUSION: This study describes a nationwide implementation of out-of-hospital ECG transmission resulting in reduced door-to-balloon times, regardless of presentation hours. Out-of-hospital ECG transmission should be adopted as best practice for management of chest pain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to compare the proportion of false-positive activations and intervention times between emergency department (ED) and field-based activation of the coronary catheterization laboratory (cath) team for emergency medical services (EMS) patients identified by out-of-hospital (OOH) 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected continuous quality improvement data at a single, urban, academic medical center. By protocol, weekday activation of the cath team occurred based on OOH notification of a computer-interpreted OOH ECG indicating potential STEMI. Night and weekend activation occurred at the discretion of the attending emergency physician (EP) after advanced ED notification and after patient arrival and assessment. Basic demographic information and cardiac risk factors were recorded, as well as door-to-balloon (DTB) and ultimate diagnosis. RESULTS: From May 2007 through March 2008, there were 23 field activations and 33 ED activations. There was no difference in demographic or clinical characteristics between the two groups. In the field activation group, 9/23 (39\%) were false-positives, while 3/33 (9\%) were false-positives in the ED activation group (30\% higher absolute difference in the field activation group, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 8\% to 52\%, p = 0.02). OOH times and time spent in the ED were similar between the two groups. DTB times were 77 minutes for field activation and 68 minutes for ED activation, respectively (difference 9 minutes, 95\% CI = -9 to 27). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physician activation of the cath team results in a lower proportion of false-positive activations without clearly sacrificing DTB time when compared to field activation based solely on the results of the OOH ECG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reperfusion of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is most effective when performed early. Notification of the cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab) prior to hospital arrival based on paramedic-performed ECGs has been proposed as a strategy to decrease time to reperfusion and mortality. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of cath lab activation prior to patient arrival versus activation after arrival at the emergency department (ED).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study (n = 1933 cases) using Los Angeles County STEMI database from May 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009. The database includes patients arriving at a STEMI Receiving Center (SRC) by ambulance who were diagnosed with STEMI either before or after hospital arrival. We compared the cohort of patients with prehospital cath lab activation to those activated from the ED within 5 minutes of first ED ECG. Outcomes measured were mortality, door-to-balloon time, percent door-to-balloon time {\textless}90 min, and percentage of false-positive activations.

RESULTS: Prehospital cath lab activations had mean door-to-balloon times 14 minutes shorter (95\% CI 11-17), in-hospital mortality 1.5\% higher (95\% CI -1.0-5.2), and false-positive activation 7.8\%, (95\% CI 2.7-13.3) higher than ED activation. For prehospital activation, 93\% (95\% CI 91-94\%) met a door-to-balloon target of 90 minutes versus 85\% (95\% CI 80-88\%) for ED activations.

CONCLUSION: Prehospital cath lab activation based on the prehospital ECG was associated with decreased door-to-balloon times but did not affect hospital mortality. False-positive activation was common and occurred more often with prehospital STEMI diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prompt reperfusion treatment is essential for patients who have myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation. Guidelines recommend that the interval between arrival at the hospital and intracoronary balloon inflation (door-to-balloon time) during primary percutaneous coronary intervention should be 90 minutes or less. However, few hospitals meet this objective. We sought to identify hospital strategies that were significantly associated with a faster door-to-balloon time.

METHODS: We surveyed 365 hospitals to determine whether each of 28 specific strategies was in use. We used hierarchical generalized linear models and data on patients from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine the association between hospital strategies and the door-to-balloon time.

RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, six strategies were significantly associated with a faster door-to-balloon time. These strategies included having emergency medicine physicians activate the catheterization laboratory (mean reduction in door-to-balloon time, 8.2 minutes), having a single call to a central page operator activate the laboratory (13.8 minutes), having the emergency department activate the catheterization laboratory while the patient is en route to the hospital (15.4 minutes), expecting staff to arrive in the catheterization laboratory within 20 minutes after being paged (vs. {\textgreater}30 minutes) (19.3 minutes), having an attending cardiologist always on site (14.6 minutes), and having staff in the emergency department and the catheterization laboratory use real-time data feedback (8.6 minutes). Despite the effectiveness of these strategies, only a minority of hospitals surveyed were using them.

CONCLUSIONS: Several specific hospital strategies are associated with a significant reduction in the door-to-balloon time in the management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation.},

Evidence demonstrates that this technology can be readily used by EMS providers to identify patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) before a patient's arrival at a hospital emergency department. Earlier identification of STEMI patients leads to faster artery-opening treatment with fibrinolytic agents, either in the pre-hospital setting or at the hospital. Alternatively, a reperfusion strategy using percutaneous coronary intervention can be facilitated by use of pre-hospital 12-lead electrocardiography (P12ECG). Analysis of the cost of providing this service to the community must include consideration of the demonstrated benefits of more rapid treatment of patients with STEMI and the resulting time savings advantage shown to accompany the use of P12ECG programs.},

Prehospital 12-lead electrocadiography (ECG) with cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation may reduce D + B time. Paramedic-performed ECG was initiated in the city of San Diego in January 2005 with STEMI diagnosis based on an automated computer algorithm. We undertook this study to determine the effect of prehospital CCL activation on D + B time for patients with acute STEMI brought to our institution. All data were prospectively collected for patients with STEMI including times to treatment and clinical outcomes. We evaluated 78 consecutive patients with STEMI from January 2005 to June 2006, and the study group consisted of all patients with prehospital activation of the CCL (field STEMI; n = 20). The control groups included concurrently-treated patients with STEMI during the same period who presented to the emergency department (nonfield STEMI; n = 28), and all patients with STEMI treated in the preceding year (2004) (historical STEMI; n = 30). Prehospital CCL activation significantly reduced D + B time (73 ?? 19 minutes field STEMI, 130 ?? 66 minutes nonfield STEMI, 141 ?? 49 minutes historical STEMI; p {\textless}0.001) with significant reductions in door-to-CCL and CCL-to-balloon times as well. The majority of patients with field STEMI achieved D + B times of {\textless}90 minutes (80\% field STEMI, 25\% nonfield STEMI, 10\% historical STEMI; p {\textless}0.001). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that prehospital electrocardiographic diagnosis of STEMI with activation of the CCL markedly reduces D + B time. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the feasibility of training paramedics of diagnose acute myocardial infarction by ECG before hospital admission and whether direct paramedic coronary care admission, arranged by very high frequency (VHF) radio communication with the coronary care unit (CCU), would reduce delay of thrombolysis treatment.

DESIGN: Prospective controlled study.

SETTING: District general hospital CCU and a local district ambulance paramedic service.

PATIENTS: 124 patients with ECG evidence of myocardial infarction or ischaemia admitted directly to the CCU by the paramedic service were compared with 123 patients admitted by the emergency department and subsequently transferred to the CCU.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ECG diagnostic accuracy by paramedics, and interval durations for CCU admission and thrombolysis.

RESULTS: ECG diagnostic accuracy by the paramedics was 87.5\% in the training phase and 92\% in admission. The total call to thrombolysis interval was reduced from 154 to 93 minutes and the "door to needle" interval was reduced from 97 to 37 minutes.

CONCLUSIONS: Trained paramedics can reliably diagnose myocardial infarction by ECG. The use of a direct admission procedure, by a VHF radio link to the CCU, substantially reduces the time interval for thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction.},

We sought to characterize experiences of hospitals with outstanding improvement in door-to-balloon time during 1999-2002.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a qualitative study using in-depth interviews (n=122) with clinical and administrative staff at 11 hospitals that were participating with the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction and had median door-to-balloon times of {\textless} or =90 minutes during 2001-2002, representing substantial improvement since 1999. Data were organized with the use of NUD-IST 4 (Sage Publications Software) and were analyzed by the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis. Eight themes characterized hospitals' experiences: commitment to an explicit goal to improve door-to-balloon time motivated by internal and external pressures; senior management support; innovative protocols; flexibility in refining standardized protocols; uncompromising individual clinical leaders; collaborative teams; data feedback to monitor progress and identify problems and successes; and an organizational culture that fostered resilience to challenges or setbacks in improvement efforts.

CONCLUSIONS: Several themes characterized the experiences of hospitals that had achieved notable improvements in their door-to-balloon times. By distilling the complex and diverse experiences of organizational change into its essential components, this study provides a foundation for future efforts to elevate clinical performance in the hospital setting.},

Patients who arrived by EMS also had higher mortality within the first hour of hospital arrival (4.2\% vs 0\%, p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that only age and systolic blood pressure were predictors of mortality. Despite faster onset of reperfusion therapy in patients who arrived by EMS, mortality was higher. Almost 33\% of these deaths occurred in the early in-hospital period, which was due to older and sicker patients having the tendency to come by EMS.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are related to reperfusion times. Given the benefit of early recognition of STEMI and resulting ability to decrease reperfusion times and improve mortality, current prehospital recommendations are to obtain electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients with concern for acute coronary syndrome.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effect of wireless transmission of prehospital ECGs on STEMI recognition and reperfusion times. We hypothesized decreased reperfusion times in patients in whom prehospital ECGs were obtained.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of patients who presented to our suburban, tertiary care, teaching hospital emergency department with STEMI on a prehospital ECG.

RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients underwent reperfusion therapy. Patients with prehospital ECGs had a mean time to angioplasty suite of 43 min (95\% confidence interval [CI] 31-54). Compared to patients with no prehospital ECG, mean time to angioplasty suite was 49 min (95\% CI 41-57), p = 0.035. Patients with prehospital STEMI identification and catheterization laboratory activation had a mean time to angioplasty suite of 33 min (95\% CI 25-41), p = 0.007. Patients with prehospital ECGs had a mean door-to-balloon time of 66 min (95\% CI 53-79), whereas the control group had a mean door-to-balloon time of 79 min (95\% CI 67-90), p = 0.024. Patients with prehospital STEMI identification and catheterization laboratory activation had a mean door-to-balloon time of 58 min (95\% CI 48-68), p = 0.018.

CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital STEMI identification allows for prompt catheterization laboratory activation, leading to decreased reperfusion times.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Treatment delay is a powerful predictor of survival in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We investigated effectiveness of pre-hospital diagnosis of STEMI with direct referral to PCI, alongside more conventional referral strategies.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2003 to December 2004, 658 STEMI patients were referred for primary PCI at our intervention laboratory. Three predefined referral routes were compared: (1) for patients within 90 min drive of the PCI centre, pre-hospital diagnosis and direct transportation (n=166), (2) diagnosis at the interventional hospital emergency department (n=316), (3) diagnosis at local hospitals before transportation (n = 176). Pre-hospital diagnosis was associated with more than 45 min reduction in treatment delay (P = 0.001). No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was apparent in the overall study population. In the cardiogenic shock subgroup (n = 80), pre-hospital diagnosis was associated with a two-thirds reduction in in-hospital mortality (P = 0.019); mortality was only 6.2\% in shock patients who underwent PCI in {\textless} 2 h.

CONCLUSION: This study shows that pre-hospital diagnosis can provide a reduction in primary PCI treatment delay, and suggests the hypothesis that this referral strategy might provide survival benefits to patients with cardiogenic shock.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous literature has documented that prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) decreases the time to reperfusion in patients with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

OBJECTIVE: To compare time to ECG, time to angioplasty suite (laboratory), and time to reperfusion in emergency medical services (EMS) STEMI patients, who received care through three different processes.

METHODS: The setting was a large suburban community teaching hospital with emergency department (ED)-initiated single-page acute myocardial infarction (AMI) team activation for STEMI patients. The population was STEMI patients transported by EMS from January 2003 to October 2005. Not all EMS agencies had prehospital 12-lead ECG capability. Paramedics interpret and verbally report clinical assessment and ECG findings via radio. The AMI team is activated at the discretion of the emergency physician 1) before patient arrival to the ED based on EMS assessment, 2) after ED evaluation with EMS ECG, or 3) after ED evaluation and ED ECG. Time intervals were calculated from ED arrival. To assess the impact of interventions on performance targets, we also report the proportion of patients who arrived in laboratory within 60 minutes and reperfusion within 90 minutes of arrival. Parametric and nonparametric statistics are used for analysis.

RESULTS: During the study period, there were 164 STEMI patients transported by EMS; mean age was 66.1 years, and 56\% were male. Of these, 93 (56.7\%) had an EMS ECG and 31 (33\%) had AMI team activation before ED arrival. Mean time to laboratory for all patients was 49.8 +/- 34.4 minutes and time to reperfusion was 93.2 +/- 34.5 min. Patients with prearrival activation were transported to laboratory sooner (mean, 24.3 vs. 53. 4 minutes; p {\textless} 0.001) and received reperfusion sooner than all other patients (mean, 70.4 vs. 96.3 minutes; p = 0.007). More prearrival activation patients met performance targets to laboratory (96.7\% vs. 73.7\%; p = 0.009) and reperfusion (85.2\% vs. 51.0\%; p = 0.003). There was no difference in time to laboratory or to reperfusion for patients who received EMS ECG but no prearrival activation compared with those who received EMS transport alone.

CONCLUSIONS: A minority of patients with EMS ECGs had prearrival AMI team activation. EMS ECGs combined with systems that activate hospital resources, but not EMS ECGs alone, decrease time to laboratory and reperfusion.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory prior to patient arrival at the hospital, based on a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), reduces door-to-balloon time by 10-55 minutes for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In emergency medical services (EMS) systems where transmission of the ECG to the emergency department (ED) is not feasible, the ability of paramedics to accurately read 12-lead ECGs is crucial to the success of a prehospital catheterization laboratory activation program. Objective. To determine whether paramedics can accurately diagnose STEMI on a prehospital 12-lead ECG and decide to activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory appropriately. METHODS: Five chest pain scenarios were generated, with standardized prehospital ECGs accompanying each: three STEMI cases that should result in catheterization laboratory activation and two non-STEMI cases that should not. A convenience sample of paramedics in an urban/suburban EMS system examined each scenario and ECG, and indicated whether the patient had STEMI and whether they would activate the catheterization laboratory. A series of demographic and operational questions were also asked of each participant. We report diagnostic statistics, agreement (kappa), and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A convenience sample of 103 of 147 eligible paramedics (70\%) was enrolled. For STEMI diagnosis, paramedics' sensitivity was 92.6\% (95\% CI 88.9-95.1) and specificity was 85.4\% (79.7-89.8); for catheterization laboratory activation, sensitivity was 88.0\% (83.8-91.3) and specificity was 88.3\% (83.0-92.2). False-positive activation of the catheterization laboratory occurred in 8.1\% (5.4-12.0) of cases. Of the STEMI cases, 94.1\% were correctly read as STEMI, and 91.0\% had the catheterization laboratory appropriately activated. Of the non-STEMI cases, 14.9\% were incorrectly read as STEMI, and 12.0\% had the catheterization laboratory inappropriately activated. The paramedics' comfort with calling a "chest pain alert" with no resulting catheterization laboratory activation (the current practice in this system) was not statistically different from their comfort with calling a chest pain alert if that call were to automatically result in catheterization laboratory activation (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Paramedics in an urban/suburban EMS system can diagnose STEMI and identify appropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory activations with a high degree of accuracy, and an acceptable false-positive rate, when tested using paper-based scenarios.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The majority of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are admitted to local hospitals without primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI) facilities. Acute transferral to an interventional centre is necessary to treat these patients with primary PCI. The present study assessed the reduction in treatment delay achieved by pre-hospital diagnosis and referral directly to an interventional centre.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two local hospitals without primary PCI facilities were serving the study region. Pre-hospital diagnoses were established with the use of telemedicine, by ambulance physicians, or by general practitioners. Primary PCI was accepted as the preferred reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI. From 31 October 2002 to 31 January 2004 all patients transported by ambulance and transferred for primary PCI were registered. Patients with STEMI were divided into three groups: (A) patients diagnosed at a local hospital (n = 55), (B) patients diagnosed pre-hospitally and admitted to a local hospital (n = 85), and (C) patients diagnosed pre-hospitally and referred directly to the interventional centre (n = 21). When comparing group A with group B and C, no difference was found in age, sex, infarct location, or distance from the scene of event to the interventional centre, whereas the median time from ambulance call to first balloon inflation was 41 min shorter in group B compared with group A (P{\textless}0.001) and 81 min shorter in group C compared with group A (P{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients scheduled for admission to a local hospital and subsequent transferral to an interventional centre for primary PCI, those diagnosed pre-hospitally had shorter treatment delay compared with those diagnosed in hospital, both in the setting of initial admission to a local hospital, and to an even larger extent in the setting of referral directly to the interventional centre.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) improves the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome.

BACKGROUND: The ECG is the most widely used screening test for evaluating patients with chest pain.

METHODS: Prehospital and in-hospital ECGs were obtained in 3,027 consecutive patients with symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction, 362 of whom were randomized to prehospital versus hospital thrombolysis and 2,665 of whom did not participate in the randomized trial. Prehospital and hospital records were abstracted for clinical characteristics and diagnostic outcome.

RESULTS: ST segment and T and Q wave abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction were more common on both the prehospital and hospital ECGs of patients with as compared with those without acute coronary syndromes (p {\textless} or = 0.00001). Those with prehospital thrombolysis were more likely to show resolution of ST segment elevation by the time of hospital admission (14\% vs. 5\% in patients treated in the hospital, p = 0.004). In patients not considered for prehospital thrombolysis, both persistent and transient ST segment and T or Q wave abnormalities discriminated those with from those without acute coronary ischemia or infarction. Compared with ST segment elevation on a single ECG, added consideration of dynamic changes in ST segment elevation between serial ECGs improved the sensitivity for an acute coronary syndrome from 34\% to 46\% and reduced specificity from 96\% to 93\% (both p {\textless} 0.00004). Overall, compared with abnormalities observed on a single ECG, consideration of serial evolution in ST segment, T or Q wave or left bundle branch block (LBBB) abnormalities between the prehospital and initial hospital ECG improved the diagnostic sensitivity for an acute coronary syndrome from 80\% to 87\%, with a fall in specificity from 60\% to 50\% (both p {\textless} 0.000006).

CONCLUSIONS: ECG abnormalities are an early manifestation of acute coronary syndromes and can be identified by the prehospital ECG. Compared with a single ECG, the additional effect of evolving ST segment, T or Q waves or LBBB between serially obtained prehospital and hospital ECGs enhanced the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, but with a fall in specificity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obtaining a prehospital 12-lead ECG may improve triage and expedite care of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Whether the ECG should undergo physician review prior to activation of a percutaneous intervention (PCI) team is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To document the positive predictive value (PPV) of the prehospital 12-lead ECG when interpreted by paramedics versus emergency physicians. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. In November 2003, our local health care and emergency medical services (EMS) systems implemented a prehospital "cardiac alert" program in which patients suspected of having ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) based on the prehospital 12-lead ECG were diverted away from receiving facilities without emergent PCI capability and the PCI team was mobilized. For the first year, a cardiac alert was activated by paramedics (Phase I). After the first year, the ECG was transmitted to the ED, with the emergency physician (EP) responsible for activation (Phase II). The PPV for cardiac alerts in Phases I and II were compared by using three different "gold standards": cardiologist interpretation of the prehospital 12-lead ECG, disposition to emergent PCI, and coronary lesions on angiography or arrest prior to emergent PCI. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were enrolled (54 in Phase I, 56 in Phase II). Cardiologist confirmation of a STEMI on the prehospital 12-lead EKG was 42/54 (78\%) in Phase I and 54/56 (96\%) in Phase II. Disposition to emergent PCI occurred in 38/54 (70\%) Phase I patients and 51/56 (91\%) Phase II patients. Lesions at catheterization or arrest prior to emergent PCI were observed in 41/54 (69\%) of Phase I patients and 50/56 (89\%) of Phase II patients. All of these comparisons achieved statistical significance (p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Transmission to the ED for EP interpretation improves the PPV of the prehospital 12-lead ECG for triage and therapeutic decision-making.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE A strategy using mechanical chest compressions might improve the poor outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but such a strategy has not been tested in large clinical trials. OBJECTIVE To determine whether administering mechanical chest compressions with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (mechanical CPR), compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (manual CPR), according to guidelines, would improve 4-hour survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized clinical trial of 2589 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest conducted between January 2008 and February 2013 in 4 Swedish, 1 British, and 1 Dutch ambulance services and their referring hospitals. Duration of follow-up was 6 months. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive either mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS Chest Compression System, Physio-Control/Jolife AB) combined with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (n = 1300) or to manual CPR according to guidelines (n = 1289). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four-hour survival, with secondary end points of survival up to 6 months with good neurological outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. A CPC score of 1 or 2 was classified as a good outcome. RESULTS Four-hour survival was achieved in 307 patients (23.6\%) with mechanical CPR and 305 (23.7\%) with manual CPR (risk difference, -0.05\%; 95\% CI, -3.3\% to 3.2\%; P {\textgreater} .99). Survival with a CPC score of 1 or 2 occurred in 98 (7.5\%) vs 82 (6.4\%) (risk difference, 1.18\%; 95\% CI, -0.78\% to 3.1\%) at intensive care unit discharge, in 108 (8.3\%) vs 100 (7.8\%) (risk difference, 0.55\%; 95\% CI, -1.5\% to 2.6\%) at hospital discharge, in 105 (8.1\%) vs 94 (7.3\%) (risk difference, 0.78\%; 95\% CI, -1.3\% to 2.8\%) at 1 month, and in 110 (8.5\%) vs 98 (7.6\%) (risk difference, 0.86\%; 95\% CI, -1.2\% to 3.0\%) at 6 months with mechanical CPR and manual CPR, respectively. Among patients surviving at 6 months, 99\% in the mechanical CPR group and 94\% in the manual CPR group had CPC scores of 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in 4-hour survival between patients treated with the mechanical CPR algorithm or those treated with guideline-adherent manual CPR. The vast majority of survivors in both groups had good neurological outcomes by 6 months. In clinical practice, mechanical CPR using the presented algorithm did not result in improved effectiveness compared with manual CPR. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00609778.},

This study aimed to determine the predictive value of prehospital ECGs interpreted by nonphysician emergency medical services (EMS) in chest pain presentations. METHODS: In our city of 658,700 people, EMS/paramedics received 21 hours of instruction on STEMI management, ECG acquisition, and interpretation. Suspected STEMI ECGs were wirelessly transmitted to and discussed with a physician for possible therapy. ECGs deemed negative for STEMI by EMS were not transmitted; patients were transported to the closest hospital without prehospital physician involvement. RESULTS: From July 21, 2008 to July 21, 2010, there were 5426 chest pain calls to EMS, 380 were suspected STEMI cases. The remaining ECGs were deemed negative for STEMI by EMS. To audit the nontransmitted ECGs we analyzed 323 consecutive patients over 2 selected months (January and June 2010) for comparison. Of nontransmitted cases there was 1 missed and 2 STEMIs that developed subsequently. Based on 380 transmitted and 323 nontransmitted cases, the sensitivity and specificity of EMS detecting STEMI were 99.6\% and 67.6\%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for STEMI were 59.5\% and 99.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate nonphysician EMS interpretation of STEMI on prehospital ECG has excellent sensitivity and high negative predictive value. This finding supports the use of prehospital ECGs interpreted by EMS to help identify and facilitate treatment of STEMI. These results may have broad implications on staffing models for first responder/EMS units.},

However, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for percutaneous coronary intervention door-to-balloon time ({\textless}90 minutes) in patients with STEMI is a infrequently accomplished goal. This study enrolled 277 patients with STEMI who were self-transported or transported by emergency medical services to NorthEast Medical Center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This study tested the hypothesis that prehospital wireless transmission of an electrocardiogram to a cardiologist's hand-held device results in shorter emergency department door-to-reperfusion time. A comparison was made between patients whose electrocardiogram was successfully transmitted during the intervention phase with (1) patients transported by the emergency medical services in the preintervention, (2) patients self-transported in the intervention phase, and (3) patients whose wireless transmission failed in the intervention phase. During the preintervention phase (2001 to 2003), 48 patients were enrolled. During the intervention phase (2003 to 2005), the following patients were enrolled: 101 self-transported patients, 24 patients with successful electrocardiographic transmission, and 19 patients for whom transmission failed. The median door-to-reperfusion time for patients with successful electrocardiographic transmission was 50 minutes, which was significantly shorter than a preintervention time of 101 minutes (p {\textless}0.0001), an intervention phase self-transport time of 96 minutes (p {\textless}0.0001), and a failed transmission time of 78 minutes (p {\textless}0.0001). In conclusion, prehospital wireless electrocardiographic transmission to a cardiologist's hand-held device significantly decreased emergency department door-to-reperfusion time, thus achieving the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for patients with STEMI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of out-of-hospital regionalization of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients to hospitals providing primary percutaneous coronary intervention depends on the accuracy of the out-of-hospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (PHTL). Although estimates of sensitivity and specificity of PHTL for STEMI have been reported, the impact of out-of-hospital STEMI prevalence on positive predictive value (PPV) has not been evaluated.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the relationship between varying population STEMI prevalences and PHTL predictive values, using ranges of PHTL sensitivity and specificity.

METHODS: The authors performed a Bayesian analysis using PHTL, where values for sensitivities (60\%-70\%), specificities (98\%), and two prevalence ranges (0.5\%-5\% and 5\%-20\%) were derived from a literature review. PPV prediction intervals were compared with three months of prospective data from the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency STEMI regionalization program.

RESULTS: When the estimated prevalence of STEMI in the out-of-hospital population is 5\%-20\%, the median PPV of the PHTL is 83\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] = 53\% to 97\%). However, if the population prevalence of STEMI is between 0.5\% and 5\%, the median PPV is 43\% (95\% CrI = 12\% to 86\%). When the PPV prediction intervals were incorporated with the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency data, the PPV was 66\%.

CONCLUSIONS: Even when assuming high specificity for PHTL, the false-positive rate will be considerable if applied to a population at low risk for STEMI. Before broadening application of PHTL to low-risk patients, the implications of a high false-positive rate should be considered.},

We assessed the safety and feasibility of an integrated metropolitan approach in which advanced-care paramedics interpret the prehospital electrocardiogram and independently refer patients with STEMI to a designated center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We developed and implemented a protocol in which paramedics trained in electrocardiographic interpretation bypassed the nearest emergency room and referred patients with suspected STEMI directly to a designated primary PCI center (paramedic-referred primary PCI). Outcomes of these patients were compared with those of a retrospective cohort of 225 consecutive patients with STEMI transported by ambulance to the nearest hospital emergency department. We treated 108 consecutive patients with STEMI using ambulance services according to the paramedic-referred primary PCI protocol. Primary PCI was performed in 93.5\% versus 8.9\% in the control group, and the median door-to-balloon time was 63 versus 125 minutes in the control group (p {\textless}0.0001 for 2 comparisons). Thrombolytic therapy was prescribed to 80.4\% of the control group, with a median door-to-needle time of 41 minutes. In-hospital mortality was 1.9\% in the paramedic-referred primary PCI group versus 8.9\% in the control group (p = 0.017) and remained significantly lower after statistical adjustment for baseline risk. In conclusion, paramedic-referred primary PCI is a safe and feasible strategy for treating STEMI that is associated with rapid and effective reperfusion and very low in-hospital mortality.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prior data from our institution suggested that our paramedics can accurately interpret ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and that activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory by paramedics immediately upon diagnosing STEMI at the scene could potentially decrease door-to-balloon (D2B) times. A "field activation" protocol was thus initiated in May 2010. This study examined D2B times and compliance with the national 90-minute D2B performance benchmark in the first 14 months. Hypothesis. We hypothesized that D2B times would be shorter, and 90-minute compliance better, when the catheterization laboratory was activated by emergency medical services (EMS), compared with when either EMS failed to activate the catheterization laboratory or when the STEMI patient arrived by means other than EMS.

METHODS: For this prospective, observational study, EMS and hospital data were reviewed for consecutive STEMI patients at a single hospital between May 2010 and July 2011. Patients were categorized as: 1) EMS field activations, 2) patients transported by EMS without EMS catheterization laboratory activation (e.g., ambulance from outside our area, paramedic missed STEMI/protocol violation), or 3) walk-in STEMI patient. Data were manipulated in Excel, means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were determined, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's correction was used to compare groups.

RESULTS: There were 38 EMS field activations, 47 nonactivation EMS STEMI arrivals, and 28 walk-in STEMI patients. The mean (±SD) D2B times were 37 (±17), 87 (±40), and 80 (±23) minutes, respectively. D2B time was better for the EMS field activations than for either nonactivation EMS transports (difference of means 35.3 min, 95\% CI 22.3-48.3 min, p {\textless} 0.001) or walk-in patients (difference of means 37.0 min, 95\% CI 21.8-52.2 min, p {\textless} 0.001). Compliance with the 90-minute D2B benchmark was 100\%, 72\%, and 68\%, respectively, and was better for the EMS field activations than for either of the other groups (p {\textless} 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: In the system studied, EMS field activation of the catheterization laboratory for patients with STEMI is associated with shorter D2B times and better compliance with 90-minute benchmarks than ED activation for either walk-in STEMI patients or STEMI patients arriving by EMS without field activation. Improvements are needed in compliance with the field activation protocol to maximize these benefits.

METHODS: All patients calling 911 for chest pain in Santa Cruz County California were monitored with a synthesized 12-lead ECG. Prehospital ECGs were printed for clinical use in the experimental group; control group patient care used only ECGs recorded after hospital arrival.

RESULTS: Five patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina had normal ECGs upon hospital arrival but evidence of ischemia in their prehospital ECGs. Three patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with "door to balloon" times of 47 and 65 minutes in 2 experimental group patients and 148 minutes in the one control group patient.

CONCLUSION: Prehospital ST monitoring appears feasible. Its potential to improve hospital time to diagnosis and treatment in acute coronary syndromes, and the clinical benefits of such improvement will be studied in the larger, ongoing ST SMART trial.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this before-and-after study is to determine whether an ED strategy which calls for cardiac catheterization lab (cath lab) activation directly by the emergency physician (EP) is effective in decreasing door-to-balloon time (DTBT).

METHODS: In our active community teaching hospital ED, with an annual census of 55,000, the traditional practice for STEMI required cardiology consultation prior to cath lab notification. In November 2003 we instituted an ED protocol which mandated direct cath lab activation by the EP for eligible STEMI patients without prior notification of the cardiologist. We measured clinically relevant time intervals, including DTBT, prior to and after institution of the protocol.

RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled after institution of the protocol; these were compared to twenty STEMI patients enrolled prior to the new protocol. DTBT decreased significantly, from 118 to 89 minutes, p=.039. Other ED parameters, including door to exam (17 vs. 15 minutes) and total ED time (80 vs. 56 minutes, p = .056) decreased post-protocol but were not significantly different for the two periods. Those arriving by ambulance continued to have a significantly lower DTBT than non-ambulance patients (pre: change of 47 minutes, p = .03, post: change of 33 minutes; p = .012). Both groups were affected similarly by the change in protocol, decreasing DTBT by approximately 25\%.

CONCLUSION: We conclude that a strategy which mandates cath lab activation by the emergency physician for STEMI without prior cardiology consultation, reduces door to balloon time.},

There are limited data on the frequency of "false-positive" catheterization laboratory activation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for suspected STEMI.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, etiology, and outcomes of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation in patients with a suspected STEMI.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective registry from a regional system that includes transfer of patients with STEMI from 30 community and rural hospitals with pretransfer catheterization laboratory activation for percutaneous coronary intervention at a tertiary cardiovascular center in Minnesota. A total of 1345 patients were enrolled from March 2003 to November 2006.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of false-positive catheterization laboratory activation in patients with suspected STEMI by 3 criteria: no culprit coronary artery, no significant coronary artery disease, and negative cardiac biomarker results.

RESULTS: Of the 1335 patients with suspected STEMI who underwent angiography, 187 (14\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 12.2\%-16.0\%) had no culprit coronary artery and 127 (9.5\%; 95\% CI, 8.0\%-11.2\%) did not have significant coronary artery disease. Cardiac biomarker levels were negative in 11.2\% (95\% CI, 9.6\%-13.0\%) of patients. The combination of no culprit artery with negative cardiac biomarker results was present in 9.2\% (95\% CI, 7.7\%-10.9\%) of patients. Thirty-day mortality was 2.7\% (95\% CI, 0.4\%-5.0\%) without vs 4.6\% (95\% CI, 3.4\%-5.8\%) with a culprit coronary artery (P = .33).

CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation for suspected STEMI is relatively common in community practice, depending on the definition of false-positive. Recent emphasis on rapid door-to-balloon times must also consider the consequences of false-positive catheterization laboratory activation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze recent trends in door-to-reperfusion time and to identify hospital characteristics associated with improved performance.

BACKGROUND: Rapid reperfusion improves survival for patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI)-3 and -4, between 1999 and 2002, we analyzed door-to-needle and door-to-balloon times in patients admitted with STEMI and receiving fibrinolytic therapy (n = 68,439 patients in 1,015 hospitals) or percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 33,647 patients in 421 hospitals) within 6 h of hospital arrival.

RESULTS: In 1999, only 46\% of the patients in the fibrinolytic therapy cohort were treated within the recommended 30-min door-to-needle time; only 35\% of the patients in the percutaneous coronary intervention cohort were treated within the recommended 90-min door-to-balloon time. Improvement in these times to reperfusion over the four-year study period was not statistically significant (door-to-needle: -0.01 min/year, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.24 to +0.23, p {\textgreater} 0.9; door-to-balloon: -0.57 min/year, 95\% CI -1.24 to +0.10, p = 0.09). Only 33\% (337 of 1,015) of hospitals improved door-to-needle time by more than one min/year, and 26\% (110 of 421) improved door-to-balloon time by more than three min/year. No hospital characteristic was significantly associated with improvement in door-to-needle time. Only high annual percutaneous coronary intervention volume and location in New England were significantly associated with greater improvement in door-to-balloon time.

CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than one-half of patients with STEMI receive reperfusion in the recommended door-to-needle or door-to-balloon time, and mean time to reperfusion has not decreased significantly in recent years. Relatively few hospitals have shown substantial improvement.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Most studies of pre-hospital management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have involved physicians accompanying the ambulance crew, or electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission to a physician at the base hospital. We sought to determine if Advanced Care Paramedics (ACPs) could accurately identify STEMI on the pre-hospital ECG and contribute to strategies that shorten time to reperfusion.

METHODS: A STEMI tool was developed to: 1) measure the accuracy of the ACPs at diagnosing STEMI; and 2) determine the potential time saved if ACPs were to independently administer thrombolytic therapy. Using registry data, we subsequently estimated the time saved by initiating thrombolytic therapy in the field compared with in-hospital administration by a physician.

RESULTS: Between August 2003 and July 2004, a correct diagnosis of STEMI on the pre-hospital ECG was confirmed in 63 patients. The performance of the ACPs in identifying STEMI on the ECG resulted in a sensitivity of 95\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 86\%-99\%), a specificity of 96\% (95\% CI 94\%-98\%), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 82\% (95\% CI 71\%-90\%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99\% (95\% CI 97\%-100\%). ACP performance for appropriately using thrombolytic therapy resulted in a sensitivity of 92\% (95\% CI 78\%-98\%), a specificity of 97\% (95\% CI 94\%-98\%), a PPV of 73\% (95\% CI 59\%-85\%) and an NPV of 99\% (95\% CI 97\%-100\%). We estimated that the median time saved by ACP administration of thrombolytic therapy would have been 44 minutes.

CONCLUSIONS: ACPs can be trained to accurately interpret the pre-hospital ECG for the diagnosis of STEMI. These results are important for the design of regional integrated programs aimed at reducing delays to reperfusion.},

Two blinded readers (cardiologist and emergency physician) independently categorized each PHTL. A third reviewer assigned final diagnoses and determined whether the PHTL met STEMI criteria. One hundred sixty-six PHTL were acquired over an 8-month period. Fifteen were excluded from analysis. Sixty-two percent of the patients (94/151) were male, mean age was 61.1 years (+/-14.8 SD, range 20-92 years), and 81\% had chest pain. Twenty-five patients (16.6\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 11\%-23.5\%) had confirmed STEMI and 16 (10.6\%) had confirmed non-STEMI acute myocardial infarction. Paramedic sensitivity was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.96); specificity was 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.00) with positive likelihood ratio of 25.2 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.21. Overall accuracy was similar for paramedic and physician reviewers (0.94, 0.93, 0.95). Highly trained paramedics in an urban emergency medical services system can identify patients with STEMI as accurately as blinded physician reviewers.},

	abstract = {To assess the impact of a field-transmitted electrocardiogram (ECG) on patients with possible acute myocardial infarction, randomized and open trials were performed with a portable electrocardiographic system coupled with a cellular phone programmed to automatically transmit ECGs to the base hospital. Consecutive patients served by the 6 units of the Salt Lake City Emergency Rescue System were studied; 71 patients were randomized to in-field ECG (n = 34) versus no ECG (n = 37). Time on scene was 16.4 +/- 9.7 minutes for the ECG group versus 16.1 +/- 7.0 minutes for the non ECG group (difference not significant). Time of transport averaged 18.2 +/- 9.9 and 17.6 +/- 13.1 minutes, respectively (difference not significant). Six of 34 patients with in-field ECG showed acute myocardial infarction, qualified for and received thrombolytic therapy at 48 +/- 12 minutes after hospital arrival (range 30 to 60) compared with 103 +/- 44 minutes (p less than 0.01) for 51 historical control patients and 68 +/- 29 minutes for 6 concurrent control patients without in-field ECG. Thus, in-field ECG causes negligible delays in paramedic time, leads to significant decreases in time to in-hospital thrombolysis and may make in-field therapy feasible. In-field ECG may be an important addition to reperfusion strategies.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate quantitatively the evidence on the diagnostic performance of out-of-hospital ECG for the diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English-language literature published between 1966 and December 1998 on the diagnostic accuracy of out-of-hospital ECG and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis. Both prospective and retrospective studies qualified for the assessment of diagnostic performance. For clinical effect, data from prospective nonrandomized studies were synthesized separately from data from randomized trials. Diagnostic performance was assessed by using estimates of test sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios and was summarized by using summary receiver-operating characteristic curves. Measures of clinical effect included time savings, early ventricular function, early mortality, and long-term survival.

RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in 11 studies with a total of 7,508 patients. Data were available for ACI in 5 studies and for AMI in 8 studies. For ACI, the random-effects pooled sensitivity was 76\% (95\% CI, 54\% to 89\%), the specificity was 88\% (95\% CI, 67\% to 96\%), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 23 (95\% CI, 6.3 to 85). The respective figures for AMI were sensitivity of 68\% (95\% CI, 59\% to 76\%), specificity of 97\% (95\% CI, 89\% to 92\%), and diagnostic odds ratio of 104 (95\% CI, 48 to 224). Both in nonrandomized (n=4, total 1,531 patients) and randomized (n=9, total 6,643 patients) studies, out-of-hospital thrombolysis shortened the time from onset of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment by 40 to 60 minutes. Data on short-term ejection fraction were sparse. Hospital mortality was reduced by 16\% (95\% CI, 2\% to 27\%) among randomized trials, and a similar estimate of effect was seen in nonrandomized studies. There was no clear effect on long-term mortality, but data were sparse.

CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital ECG has excellent diagnostic performance for AMI and very good performance for ACI. Out-of-hospital thrombolysis achieves time savings and improves short-term mortality, but the effect on long-term mortality is unknown.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of door-to-balloon time with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on late cardiac mortality.

BACKGROUND: The impact of door-to-balloon time on outcomes is controversial, and the impact on late mortality has not been studied.

METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 2,322) treated with primary PCI from 1984 to 2003 were prospectively identified and followed up for a median of 83 months.

RESULTS: Prolonged door-to-balloon times (0 to 1.4 h vs. 1.5 to 1.9 h vs. 2.0 to 2.9 h vs. {\textgreater} or =3.0 h) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality (4.9\% vs. 6.1\% vs. 8.0\% vs. 12.2\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and late mortality (12.6\% vs. 16.4\% vs. 20.4\% vs. 27.1\% at 7 years, p {\textless} 0.0001) and were an independent predictor of late mortality by Cox regression (p = 0.0004). Prolonged door-to-balloon times ({\textgreater} or =2 h vs. {\textless}2 h) were associated with higher late mortality in high-risk patients (32.5\% vs. 21.5\%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 1.90; p = 0.0002) but not in low-risk patients (10.8\% vs. 9.2\%; HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 1.64; p = 0.53) and in patients presenting early ({\textless} or =3 h) (24.7\% vs. 15.0\%; HR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.24 to 1.90; p = 0.0001) but not late ({\textgreater}3 h) (21.1\% vs. 18.5\%; HR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.45; p = 0.80).

CONCLUSIONS: Delays in door-to-balloon time impact late survival in high-risk but not low-risk patients and in patients presenting early but not late after the onset of symptoms. These findings have implications for the triage of patients for primary PCI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (PHECG) interpretation and advance emergency department (ED) notification may improve time-to-treatment intervals for a variety of treatment strategies to improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction. Despite consensus guidelines recommending this intervention, few emergency medical services (EMS) employ this. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to report whether mortality or treatment time intervals improved when compared with standard care.

METHODS: The authors used the Cochrane strategy to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, and Index of Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Bibliographies and grant-agency Websites were reviewed, and primary investigators and industry were contacted for published and unpublished studies. Inclusion criteria included PHECG and advance ED notification versus standard EMS care; controlled trials; English only; and evaluation of treatment time intervals, all-cause mortality, or both. Study selection was hierarchical, blinded, and independent. Agreement at each level of review was evaluated by using a kappa statistic. Study quality was measured with a validated scale and was interpreted by two independent reviewers.

RESULTS: A total of 1,283 citations were identified, and five studies met the inclusion criteria. The weighted kappa for selection was 0.61 (standard error [SE], 0.045) for titles, 0.63 (SE, 0.051) for abstracts, and 0.79 (SE, 0.146) for full articles. Mean study quality measures by two independent reviewers were 6.0/15 and 5.5/15 (correlation coefficient, 0.85; p = 0.06). PHECG and advance ED notification increased the weighted mean on-scene time by 1.2 minutes (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = -0.84 to 3.2). The weighted mean door-to-needle interval was shortened by 36.1 minutes (95\% CI = 9.3 to 63.0: range of means, 22-48 minutes vs. 50-97 minutes). One study reported all-cause mortality, with a statistically nonsignificant reduction from 15.6\% to 8.4\%.

CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AMI, the literature would suggest that PHECG and advanced ED notification reduces in hospital time to fibrinolysis. One controlled trial found no difference in mortality with this out-of-hospital intervention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the use of pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing reperfusion therapy, and evaluate the effect of pre-hospital ECG on door-to-reperfusion times.

BACKGROUND: Although national guidelines recommend the use of pre-hospital ECG, there is limited contemporary information about its current use and effectiveness.

METHODS: Using data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-4, we studied patients with STEMI or left bundle branch block who received acute reperfusion with either fibrinolytic therapy (n = 35,370) or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 21,277) within 6 h of admission. We determined the prevalence of pre-hospital ECG use, evaluated the association between pre-hospital ECG and door-to-reperfusion time, and estimated the incremental reduction in time to reperfusion using hierarchical models to adjust for differences in patient and hospital characteristics.

RESULTS: A pre-hospital ECG was performed in 4.5\% of the fibrinolytic therapy cohort and in 8.0\% of the PCI cohort. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, the use of pre-hospital ECG was associated with a significantly shorter geometric mean door-to-drug time: 24.6 min (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 23.7 to 25.5) vs. 34.7 min (95\% CI: 34.2 to 35.3; p {\textless} 0.0001), and a significantly shorter geometric mean door-to-balloon time (94.0 min [95\% CI: 91.8 to 96.3] vs. 110.3 min [95\% CI: 108.7 to 112.0]; p {\textless} 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: The national use of pre-hospital ECG to diagnose and facilitate the treatment of STEMI remains low. When used, however, pre-hospital ECG is associated with a significantly shorter time to reperfusion.},

METHODS: We studied a consecutive series of patients suspected to have STEMI who were taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the 6-month period before hotline implementation (historical controls) and during the first year of hotline use (intervention group, hotline; emergency medical service patients without hotline, concurrent controls).

RESULTS: Emergency medical services activated the hotline 47 times, and 25 patients were subsequently taken to the catheterization laboratory. Patients who received PCI involving hotline use (n = 20) had significantly shorter door-to-balloon times (58 minutes; 25th-75th percentile, 52-73 minutes) than historical controls (n = 15) (112 minutes; 25th-75th percentile, 81-137; P {\textless} .0001) and concurrent controls (n = 15) (92 minutes; 25th-75th percentile, 76-112; P = .019).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the recommended revascularization strategy for patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In most hospitals, transfer of patients with STEMI is organized from the emergency site via emergency room (medical and cardiologic evaluation) and then to the catheterization laboratory.

HYPOTHESIS: In this prospective study, we sought to evaluate the effect of a logistic modification in this treatment process.

METHODS: Local emergency ambulance teams were instructed to identify and evaluate patients with STEMI eligible for direct PCI and to transport them directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for immediate percutaneous coronary intervention ("ER bypass"). This study prospectively included 74 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes (STEMI) and compared them with a matched historic control group ("ER evaluation"). Primary endpoint was the reduction in door-to-balloon time; secondary endpoint was quality of preclinical emergency diagnosis.

RESULTS: Median door-to-balloon time was reduced by 27 min. Primary interventional success was achieved in 92\% of patients. Preclinical emergency diagnoses were correct in 95\% of patients.

CONCLUSION: The preclinical emergency diagnosis of STEMI was reliable. Direct transport of patients with STEMI to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and early preclinical alert by the interventional PCI team significantly reduces door-to-balloon-times compared with established standard processes-of-care for patients considered for primary PCI.},

	abstract = {STUDY HYPOTHESIS: It is feasible to apply prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography to most stable prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital diagnostic accuracy is improved compared with single-lead telemetry.

POPULATION: One-hundred sixty-six stable adult patients who sought paramedic evaluation for a chief complaint of nontraumatic chest pain.

METHODS: One-hundred fifty-one prehospital 12-lead ECGs of diagnostic quality were obtained by paramedics on 166 adult patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain. Paramedics and base station physicians were blinded to the information on acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs and treated patients according to current standard of care-clinical diagnosis and single-lead telemetry. Final hospital diagnoses were classified into three groups: acute myocardial infarction (24); suspected angina or ischemia (61); and nonischemic chest pain (66). Paramedics and base station physicians' clinical diagnoses and prehospital and emergency department ECGs were similarly classified and compared. Prehospital and ED 12-lead ECGs were read retrospectively by two cardiologists.

RESULTS: Paramedics achieved a high success rate (98.7\%) in obtaining diagnostic quality prehospital 12-lead ECGs in 94.6\% of eligible prehospital patients. For patients with acute myocardial infarction, prehospital ECG alone had significantly higher specificity than did the paramedic clinical diagnosis (99.2\% vs 70.9\%; P less than .001), and significantly higher positive predictive value (92.9\% vs 32.7\%; P less than .001). For patients with angina, combining the paramedic clinical diagnosis and the prehospital ECG significantly improved sensitivity (90.2\% vs 62.3\%; P less than .001) and increased negative predictive value (88.9\% vs 71.3\%; P less than .02) compared with paramedic clinical diagnosis alone. There was a high concordance between prehospital and ED ECG diagnosis (99.3\% for acute myocardial infarction and 92.8\% for angina). Furthermore, ten patients whose prehospital ECGs demonstrated ischemia and who had final hospital diagnoses of angina or acute myocardial infarction were mistriaged by paramedics and/or received no base station physician-directed therapy.

CONCLUSION: It is feasible to apply prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography to most stable prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital 12-lead ECGs have the potential to significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy in chest pain patients, approach congruity with ED 12-lead ECG diagnoses, and may allow for consideration of altering and improving prehospital and hospital-based management in this patient population.},

	abstract = {The extent of myocardial damage occurring during acute myocardial infarction is time dependent, and there is abundant evidence from most clinical trials that mortality reduction is greatest in patients treated early with thrombolytic agents, although beneficial effects have been shown with treatment initiated up to 12 hours after onset of symptoms. This temporal dependence of benefit was most clearly seen with the 47\% mortality reduction obtained with streptokinase given within the first hour in the GISSI-1 trial (Table 1). The process of infarction may be completely aborted if reperfusion is initiated within 30 minutes after symptom onset. Current approaches designed to reduce the time delay between onset of symptoms and the initiation of thrombolytic treatment include increasing public awareness of the need to seek prompt medical attention in the event of chest pain, reducing in-hospital delays in initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and administration of thrombolytic agents in the prehospital setting. Since the first paper on prehospital thrombolysis by Koren et al. in 1985 there have been numerous studies published, including several randomized trials comparing prehospital and in-hospital initiation of thrombolytic therapy (Table 2). In randomized studies patients received in the pre-hospital phase either a bolus or infusion with the thrombolytic agent followed by placebo after hospital admission, or placebo when first seen outside the hospital, followed by the thrombolytic agent after arrival at the hospital. This was performed in a double-blind fashion in some of the trials. Some of the studies on prehospital thrombolysis have focused only on feasibility and safety, others on time gain, differences in ejection fraction and mortality benefit. Almost all have conclusively shown the practicability and safety of patient selection and administration of the thrombolytic agent. This positive result was observed in different organizational types of the emergency system: In the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention trial (MITI) patients with chest pain were screened by paramedics using a checklist of clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria. The paramedics then obtained a computer-interpreted ECG which was transmitted to the emergency department in the hospital where a physician made the decision on the form of treatment. The thrombolytic agent was then administered by the paramedic. In the European Myocardial Infarction Project (EMIP) an emergency physician was personally present and responsible in the prehospital setting, whereas in the Grampian Region Early Anistreplase Trial (GREAT) general practitioners made the decision for enrolling the patient.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the association of pre-hospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) and the timing of reperfusion therapy for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

BACKGROUND: Pre-hospital ECGs have been recommended in the management of patients with chest pain transported by emergency medical services (EMS).

METHODS: We evaluated patients with STEMI from the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) registry who were transported by EMS from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007. Patients were stratified by the use of pre-hospital ECGs, and timing of reperfusion therapy was compared between the 2 groups.

RESULTS: A total of 7,098 of 12,097 patients (58.7\%) utilized EMS, and 1,941 of these 7,098 EMS transport patients (27.4\%) received a pre-hospital ECG. Among the EMS transport population, primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 92.1\% of patients with a pre-hospital ECG versus 86.3\% with an in-hospital ECG, whereas fibrinolytic therapy was used in 4.6\% versus 4.2\% of patients. Median door-to-needle times for patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy (19 min vs. 29 min, p = 0.003) and median door-to-balloon times for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (61 min vs. 75 min, p {\textless} 0.0001) were significantly shorter for patients with a pre-hospital ECG. A suggestive trend for a lower risk of in-hospital mortality was observed with pre-hospital ECG use (adjusted odds ratio: 0.80, 95\% confidence interval: 0.63 to 1.01).

CONCLUSIONS: Only one-quarter of these patients transported by EMS receive a pre-hospital ECG. The use of a pre-hospital ECG was associated with a greater use of reperfusion therapy, faster reperfusion times, and a suggested trend for a lower risk of mortality.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the accuracy of emergency medical services (EMS) activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and its impact on treatment intervals from dispatch to reperfusion.

METHODS: We conducted a before-and-after cohort study of patients presenting via EMS with prehospital electrocardiogram findings consistent with STEMI. Before August 20, 2007, percutaneous coronary intervention was initiated after patient arrival. Afterward, EMS providers could activate the CCL if the prehospital electrocardiogram automated interpretation indicated STEMI. All interval times from EMS dispatch to percutaneous coronary intervention were measured via synchronized timepieces.

RESULTS: A total of 53 patients, 14 before and 39 after prehospital activation, were included. Emergency medical services CCL activation was 79.6\% sensitive (95\% confidence interval [CI], 65.2\%-89.3\%) and 99.7\% specific (95\% CI, 99.1\%-99.9\%). Mean door-to-hospital electrocardiogram and mean CCL-to-reperfusion times were unaffected by the intervention. Prehospital activation of the CCL significantly improved mean door-to-balloon (D2B) time by 18.2 minutes (95\% CI, 7.69-28.71 minutes; P = .0029) and door-to-CCL by 14.8 minutes (95\% CI, 6.20-23.39 minutes; P = .0024). Improvements in D2B were independent of presentation during peak hours (F ratio = 17.02, P {\textless} .0001). There were significant time savings reflected in all EMS intervals: 20.7 minutes (95\% CI, 9.1-32.3 minutes; P = .0015) in mean dispatch-to-reperfusion time, 22.2 minutes (95\% CI, 11.45-32.95 minutes; P = .0003) in mean first medical contact-to-reperfusion time, and 20 minutes (95\% CI, 10.95-29.05 minutes; P = .0001) in recognition-to-reperfusion time.

CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medical service providers can appropriately activate the CCL for patients with STEMI before emergency department arrival, significantly reducing mean D2B time. Significant reduction is demonstrated throughout EMS intervals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) on door-to-balloon times for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients prior to the establishment of formally designated STEMI receiving centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective study comparing door-to-balloon times for acute STEMI patients transported by paramedics using prehospital 12-lead ECGs with those who arrived via self-transport at four Los Angeles area EDs that performed emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Paramedics calling in from the field verbally notified receiving hospitals of a "STEMI patient." Activation of the hospital's PCI team was at the discretion of the receiving emergency physician. During the study period, there were no formal diversion criteria for STEMI patients. The main outcome measure was door-to-balloon time. RESULTS: During the study period, 234 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 168 (72\%) were male. The mean age was 62 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age, gender, or ethnicity of the two groups. Median door-to-balloon times were 95 minutes and 108 minutes in the EMS and self-transport groups, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05; 95\% confidence interval 3.5-16.4). CONCLUSION: Paramedic transport of STEMI patients with prehospital 12-lead ECG acquisition was associated with shorter door-to-balloon times than the times for patients who self-transported to PCI-capable EDs.},

To determine the relative importance of prehospital mode of patient transport and the relative impact of emergency medical system transport with or without a prehospital cellular electrocardiogram (ECG) on hospital time delays to initiation of thrombolytic therapy, four prospective parallel groups of patients with acute myocardial infarction were evaluated. The median hospital time delay to treatment median (twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles) was 64 minutes (46 and 87 minutes, respectively, for twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles) for patients transported by private automobile ("walk-in"); 55 minutes (45 and 68 minutes, respectively) for patients transported by local ambulance; 50 minutes (38 and 81 minutes, respectively) for patients transported by the emergency medical system without a prehospital ECG; and 30 minutes (27 and 35 minutes, respectively) for patients transported by the emergency medical system who had a 12-lead ECG transmitted from the field. Patients transported by the emergency medical system were randomized to receive cellular telephone transmission of a prehospital 12-lead ECG. Specialized emergency medical system transport alone did not facilitate in-hospital initiation of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction when compared with those brought by local ambulance or by private automobile. A significant reduction in hospital time delay to treatment was observed only in patients transported by the emergency medical system who had cellular transmission of a prehospital 12-lead ECG from the field.},

	abstract = {Background Previous studies have demonstrated significant associations between cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality metrics and survival to hospital discharge. No adequately powered study has explored the relationship between location of resuscitation (scene vs. transport) and CPR quality. Methods We analyzed CPR quality data from treated adult OHCA occurring over a 40 month period beginning January 1, 2013 from the Rescu Epistry-cardiac arrest database. High quality CPR was defined as chest compression fraction (CCF) {\textgreater}0.7, compression rate {\textgreater}100/min and compression depth {\textgreater}5.0 cm. Our primary objective was to compare the proportion of resuscitations for which all CPR quality benchmarks were met between scene and transport phases of resuscitation. Our secondary objectives were to compare the quality of CPR between the scene phase and transport phase of resuscitation. Results The proportion of patients with high quality CPR was similar on scene compared to during transport (45.8\% vs. 42.5\%; ∆ 3.3 \%; 95\% CI: −1.4, 8.1). Regarding individual CPR metrics, median compression rate was higher on scene compared to transport (105.8 compressions per minute (cpm) vs. 102.0 cpm; ∆ 3.8 cpm; 95\% CI: 2.5, 4.0), while median compression depth (5.56 cm vs. 5.33 cm; ∆ 0.23 cm; 95\% CI: 0.12, 0.26) and median CCF (0.95 vs. 0.87; ∆ 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.08) were higher during the transport phase. Conclusions High quality CPR metrics were similar in both (scene and transport) locations of resuscitation. These results suggest that high quality, manual compressions can be performed by prehospital providers regardless of location.},

METHODS: Time from symptom onset to arrival at hospital and emergency medical service use were abstracted from medical records of 18,928 patients hospitalized for AMI and captured in the community surveillance component of the ARIC study from 1987 to 2000. A cut point of 4 hours was used to assess clinically relevant delay time recommendations for treatment with current therapies.

RESULTS: In 2000, the overall proportion of persons with delays from symptom onset to hospital arrival of {\textgreater} or = 4 hours was 49.5\%. Blacks and women consistently delayed longer than whites and men. Between 1987 and 2000, there was no statistically significant change in the proportion of patients delaying {\textgreater} or = 4 hours (relative change +0.6\% in men, -7.4\% in women, -2.3\% in whites, -8.9\% in blacks, -7.9\% in persons with diabetes, and -0.8\% in persons without diabetes); however, there is a noticeable narrowing of gaps between sex, race, and diabetes status over the study period. The percentage of those who used emergency medical services increased significantly over the study period (1987 37.1\%, 2000 44.5\%, P {\textless} or = .0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Many patients continue to experience prolonged delays from onset of symptoms to hospital arrival. Delay time for hospitalized AMI changed little in the ARIC communities from 1987 to 2000. New public health strategies should be developed to facilitate rapid access to acute care for AMI.},

	abstract = {Because the benefits from thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are time dependent, multiple strategies have been devised to speed therapy. This study sought to determine whether hospital-based nurse and paramedic advanced life support (ALS) providers could be trained to independently evaluate (sight read) a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for the presence of AMI as part of a protocol designed to speed in-hospital administration of thrombolytic agents. Providers were required to determine on the basis of a protocol (1) whether or not AMI was present, and (2) whether or not thrombolytic therapy was indicated. Providers then radioed their impression to the emergency department (ED) and initiated a protocol to prepare identified candidates for thrombolysis. The final decision to initiate thrombolytic therapy was made by the ED physician after patient arrival at the hospital. One hundred fifty-five patients with chest pain were studied. Twenty-one (13.5\%) were ultimately proven in-hospital to have AMI. Providers were able to recognize AMI in 17 of 21. Four of 21 did not meet ECG criteria for AMI on the field ECG, but were categorized as having a high index of suspicion for AMI by providers. There were no false-positive diagnoses. Fourteen patients (9\%) received thrombolytic therapy. In-hospital times to administration of thrombolytic therapy decreased to an average of 22 +/- 13.8 minutes in the studied group compared with a historical control group average of 51 +/- 50 minutes. It is concluded that hospital-based paramedics and nurses can successfully be taught to evaluate (ie, sight read) a prehospital ECG for the presence of AMI with accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review prehospital management of patients with suspected ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on the acquisition and interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs), and the effects of thrombolytic therapy initiated by prehospital care providers.

DESIGN: MEDLINE was searched by combining the search phrases 'thrombolysis,' 'paramedics' and 'myocardial infarction' to identify all pertinent articles. The bibliographies were reviewed to search for other relevant articles.

RESULTS: The earlier that treatment is initiated in AMI, the better the prognosis. Multiple randomized and nonrandomized trials indicate that prehospital care providers (including paramedics, nurses and doctors) are able to acquire prehospital ECGs with negligible increases in on-scene time, ranging from 30 s to 7 mins. With minimal training, they are capable of accurately interpreting ECGs and diagnosing ST elevation AMI, with results comparable with control ECGs obtained by physicians. Numerous studies have investigated the role of specially trained prehospital personnel in initiating thrombolysis. Trials outside of North America have predominantly used physicians, whereas North American studies employed paramedics. Thrombolysis has been shown to be safe and effective when started outside the hospital by physicians or paramedics, with a reduction in time to treatment and no increase in complications. The further a patient with ST elevation AMI is from hospital, the greater the potential benefit of prehospital thrombolysis. The European Myocardial Infarction Project (EMIP), the largest randomized trial of prehospital thrombolysis, demonstrated a trend towards reduced mortality but was underpowered to detect significant mortality differences. The Grampian Region Early Anistreplase Trial (GREAT), a rural study, is the only randomized trial to demonstrate a statistically significant mortality difference in patients receiving prehospital thrombolysis. Despite trends in favour of prehospital diagnosis and treatment of AMI, no urban study has been sufficiently powered to demonstrate mortality benefits.

CONCLUSION: Prehospital treatment of patients with chest pain using ECGs and thrombolysis is safe. Though rural patients have significant reductions in total mortality when treated with thrombolysis in a prehospital setting, this has not been documented with an urban population. Prehospital identification of thrombolysis-eligible patients with ST elevation AMI via acquisition and interpretation of ECGs followed by triage to a hospital 'lytic team' has the potential to improve patient outcome and requires further investigation. A prehospital paramedic program for identifying and treating thrombolysis-eligible patients requires intensive planning, retrospective feasibility work, implementation and monitoring to establish effectiveness.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE We seek to determine whether cardiac risk factor burden (defined as the number of conventional cardiac risk factors present) is useful for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes in the emergency department (ED) setting. METHODS This was a post hoc analysis of the Internet Tracking Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes (i*trACS) registry, which had 17,713 ED visits for suspected acute coronary syndromes. First visit for US patients who were not cocaine or amphetamine users, who did not leave against medical advice, and for whom ECG and demographic data were complete were included. Acute coronary syndrome was defined by 30-day revascularization, diagnostic-related group codes, or death within 30 days, with positive cardiac biomarkers at index hospitalization. Cardiac risk factors were diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and family history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac risk factor burden was defined as the number of risk factors present. Because multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age modified the relationship between cardiac risk factor burden and acute coronary syndromes, a stratified analysis was performed for 3 age categories: younger than 40, 40 to 65, and older than 65 years. Positive likelihood ratios and negative likelihood ratios with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each total risk factor cutoff. RESULTS Of 10,806 eligible patients, 871 (8.1\%) had acute coronary syndromes. In patients younger than 40 years, having no risk factors had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.17 (95\% CI 0.04 to 0.66), and having 4 or more risk factors had a positive likelihood ratio of 7.39 (95\% CI 3.09 to 17.67). In patients between 40 and 65 years of age, having no risk factors had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.53 (95\% CI 0.40 to 0.71), and having 4 or more risk factors had a positive likelihood ratio of 2.13 (95\% CI 1.66 to 2.73). In patients older than 65 years, having no risk factors had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.96 (95\% CI 0.74 to 1.23), and having 4 or more risk factors had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.09 (95\% CI 0.64 to 1.62). CONCLUSION Cardiac risk factor burden has limited clinical value in diagnosing acute coronary syndromes in the ED setting, especially in patients older than 40 years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ST elevation (STE) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) may be due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or other nonischemic pathologies such as left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). The objective of this study was to validate 2 previously derived ECG rules to distinguish AMI from LVA. The first rule states that if the sum of T-wave amplitudes in leads V1 to V4 divided by the sum of QRS amplitudes in leads V1 to V4 is greater than 0.22, then acute ST-segment elevation MI is predicted. The second rule states that if any 1 lead (V1-V4) has a T-wave amplitude to QRS amplitude ratio greater than or equal to 0.36, then acute ST-segment elevation MI is predicted. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with AMI (n = 59) and LVA (n = 16) who presented with ischemic symptoms and STE on the ECG. For each ECG, the T-wave amplitude and QRS amplitude in leads V1 to V4 were measured. These measurements were applied to the 2 ECG rules; and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting AMI vs LVA were calculated. RESULTS: For rule 1 (sum of ratios in V1-V4), sensitivity was 91.5\%, specificity was 68.8\%, and accuracy was 86.7\% in predicting AMI. For rule 2 (maximum ratio in V1-V4), sensitivity was 91.5\%, specificity was 81.3\%, and accuracy was 89.3\% in predicting AMI. CONCLUSIONS: When patients present to the emergency department with ischemic symptoms and the differential diagnosis for STE on the ECG is AMI vs LVA, these 2 ECG rules may be helpful in differentiating these 2 pathologies. Both rules are highly sensitive and accurate in predicting AMI vs LVA.},

	abstract = {Background The Valsalva manoeuvre is an internationally recommended treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but cardioversion is rare in practice (5-20\%), necessitating the use of other treatments including adenosine, which patients often find unpleasant. We assessed whether a postural modification to the Valsalva manoeuvre could improve its effectiveness. Methods We did a randomised controlled, parallel-group trial at emergency departments in England. We randomly allocated adults presenting with supraventricular tachycardia (excluding atrial fibrillation and flutter) in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a modified Valsalva manoeuvre (done semi-recumbent with supine repositioning and passive leg raise immediately after the Valsalva strain), or a standard semi-recumbent Valsalva manoeuvre. A 40 mm Hg pressure, 15 s standardised strain was used in both groups. Randomisation, stratified by centre, was done centrally and independently, with allocation with serially numbered, opaque, sealed, tamper-evident envelopes. Patients and treating clinicians were not masked to allocation. The primary outcome was return to sinus rhythm at 1 min after intervention, determined by the treating clinician and electrocardiogram and confirmed by an investigator masked to treatment allocation. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN67937027). Findings We enrolled 433 participants between Jan 11, 2013, and Dec 29, 2014. Excluding second attendance by five participants, 214 participants in each group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 37 (17\%) of 214 participants assigned to standard Valsalva manoeuvre achieved sinus rhythm compared with 93 (43\%) of 214 in the modified Valsalva manoeuvre group (adjusted odds ratio 3·7 (95\% CI 2·3-5·8; p{\textless}0·0001). We recorded no serious adverse events. Interpretation In patients with supraventricular tachycardia, a modified Valsalva manoeuvre with leg elevation and supine positioning at the end of the strain should be considered as a routine first treatment, and can be taught to patients.

However, some patients show ST elevation on electrocardiography (ECG), but do not have myocardial infarction. We sought to identify the frequency of and to develop a prediction model for false-positive STEMI. METHODS This study was conducted in the emergency departments (EDs) of two hospitals using the same critical pathway (CP) protocol to treat STEMI patients with primary PCI. The prediction model was developed in a derivation cohort and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. RESULTS Of the CP-activated patients, those for whom ST elevation did not meet the ECG criteria were excluded. Among the patients with appropriate ECG patterns, the incidence of false-positive STEMI in the entire cohort was 16.3\%. Independent predictors extracted from the derivation cohort for false-positive STEMI were age {\textless} 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.54; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-4.89), no chest pain (OR, 12.04; 95\% CI, 5.92-25.63), atypical chest pain (OR, 7.40; 95\% CI, 3.27-17.14), no reciprocal change (OR, 4.80; 95\% CI, 2.54-9.51), and concave-morphology ST elevation (OR, 14.54; 95\% CI, 6.87-34.37). Based on the regression coefficients, we established a simplified risk score. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for our risk score were 0.839 (95\% CI, 0.724-0.954) and 0.820 (95\% CI, 0.727-0.913), respectively; the positive predictive values were 40.9\% and 22.0\%, respectively; and the negative predictive values were 94.9\% and 96.7\%, respectively. DISCUSSION Our prediction model would help them make rapid decisions with better rationale. CONCLUSION We devised a model to predict false-positive STEMI. Larger-scale validation studies are needed to validate our model, and a prospective study to determine whether this model is effective in reducing improper primary PCI in actual clinical practice should be performed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Out-of-hospital advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) has not consistently shown a positive impact on survival. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) could render prolonged on-site resuscitation (ACLS or basic cardiac life support [BCLS]) undesirable in selected cases. The objectives of this study were to evaluate, in patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in a subgroup of potential E-CPR candidates, the association between the addition of prehospital ACLS to BCLS and survival to hospital discharge, prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and delay from call to hospital arrival. METHODS This cohort study targets adult patients treated for OHCA between April 2010 and December 2015 in the city of Montreal, Canada. We defined potential E-CPR candidates using clinical criteria previously described in the literature (65 years of age or younger, initial shockable rhythm, absence of ROSC after 15 minutes of prehospital resuscitation, and emergency medical services-witnessed collapse or witnessed collapse with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Associations were evaluated using multivariate regression models. RESULTS A total of 7,134 patients with OHCA were included, 761 (10.7\%) of whom survived to discharge. No independent association between survival to hospital discharge and the addition of prehospital ACLS to BCLS was found in either the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.05 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} = 0.84-1.32], p = 0.68) or among the 246 potential E-CPR candidates (AOR = 0.82 [95\% CI = 0.36-1.84], p = 0.63). The addition of prehospital ACLS to BCLS was associated with a significant increase in the rate of prehospital ROSC in all patients experiencing OHCA (AOR = 3.92 [95\% CI = 3.38-4.55], p {\textless} 0.001) and in potential E-CPR candidates (AOR = 3.48 [95\% CI = 1. 76-6.88], p {\textless} 0.001) compared to isolated prehospital BCLS. Delay from call to hospital arrival was longer in the ACLS group than in the BCLS group (difference = 16 minutes [95\% CI = 15-16 minutes], p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In a tiered-response urban emergency medical service setting, prehospital ACLS is not associated with an improvement in survival to hospital discharge in patients suffering from OHCA and in potential E-CPR candidates, but with an improvement in prehospital ROSC and with longer delay to hospital arrival.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron, focusing primarily on its effects on haemoglobin, requirement for transfusion, and risk of infection. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron therapy. DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled trials from Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to June 2013, with no language restrictions. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials of intravenous iron compared with either no iron or oral iron. Crossover and observational studies were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in haemoglobin concentration and risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion (efficacy) and risk of infection (safety). RESULTS: Of the 75 trials meeting the inclusion criteria, 72 studies including 10 605 patients provided quantitative outcome data for meta-analysis. Intravenous iron was associated with an increase in haemoglobin concentration (standardised mean difference 6.5 g/L, 95\% confidence interval 5.1 g/L to 7.9 g/L) and a reduced risk of requirement for red blood cell transfusion (risk ratio 0.74, 95\% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.88), especially when intravenous iron was used with erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs) or in patients with a lower baseline plasma ferritin concentration. There were no significant interactions between the efficacy of intravenous iron and type or dose administered. Intravenous iron was, however, associated with a significant increase in risk of infection (relative risk 1.33, 95\% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.64) compared with oral or no iron supplementation. The results remained similar when only high quality trials were analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron therapy is effective in increasing haemoglobin concentration and reducing the risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and could have broad applicability to a range of acute care settings. This potential benefit is counterbalanced by a potential increased risk of infection},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND When traditional vascular access methods fail, emergency access through the intraosseous (IO) route can be lifesaving. Fluids, medications, and blood components have all been delivered through these devices. We sought to compare the performance of IO devices placed in the sternum, humeral head, and proximal tibia using a fresh human cadaver model. METHODS Commercially available IO infusion devices were placed into fresh human cadavers: sternum (FAST-1), humeral head (EZ-IO), and proximal tibia (EZ-IO). Sequentially, the volume of 0.9\% saline infused into each site under 300 mm Hg pressure over 5 minutes was measured. Rates of successful initial IO device placement and subjective observations related to the devices were also recorded. RESULTS For 16 cadavers over a 5-minute bolus infusion, the total volume of fluid infused at the three IO access sites was 469 (190) mL for the sternum, 286 (218) mL for the humerus, and 154 (94) mL for the tibia. Thus, the mean (SD) flow rate infused at each site was as follows: (1) sternum, 93.7 (37.9) mL/min; (2) humerus, 57.1 (43.5) mL/min; and (3) tibia, 30.7 (18.7) mL/min. The tibial site had the greatest number of insertion difficulties. CONCLUSION This is the first study comparing the rate of flow at the three most clinically used adult IO infusion sites in an adult human cadaver model. Our results showed that the sternal site for IO access provided the most consistent and highest flow rate compared with the humeral and tibial insertion sites. The average flow rate in the sternum was 1.6 times greater than in the humerus and 3.1 times greater than in the tibia.},

Databases searched included PubMed, Cochrane Database, Google Scholar, Science Citation Index, EMBASE and manual searching of bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Studies were included if sublingual nitroglycerine was the index test, its effect on the patient's pain score was recorded and the reference test was performed on at least 80\% of patients. The data from the five papers were used to form 2×2 contingency tables. Five eligible studies were found, all in the acute setting (although one paper collected its data in the follow-up setting, all patients had acute presentations). The sensitivity ranged from 35\% to 92\% and the specificity from 12\% to 63\%. However, in all but one paper the Youden indices were close to zero suggesting that the response to nitroglycerine is not useful as a diagnostic test. The combined sensitivity was 0.52 (95\% CI 0.48 to 0.56) and combined specificity was 0.49 (95\% CI 0.46 to 0.52). The diagnostic OR from the combined studies was 1.2 (95\% CI 0.97 to 1.5), which is not significantly different from 1. In the acute setting, nitroglycerine is not a reliable test of treatment for use in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. However, further studies are needed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of nitroglycerine for recurrent exertional chest pain.},

We conducted a study to determine the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of J-point location and measurement of the magnitude of ST elevation at the J-point on ECGs of patients with STEMI by emergency department (ED) doctors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Each participant examined 20 STEMI ECGs during a 1-month period in 2013. The participants were required to locate the J-point by selecting the small 1 mm square within which the J-point is located and measure the magnitude of ST elevation at the J-point identified (rounded up to the nearest 0.5 mm). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess the IRR. RESULTS Thirty doctors participated. The ICC assessing the degree to which all participants provided agreement in their assessment of the location of J-points across ECGs was 0.85 (95\% CI 0.75 to 0.93), which is in the excellent range. The ICC for assessing the magnitude of ST elevation was 0.97 (95\% CI 0.94 to 0.98), indicating excellent agreement as well. CONCLUSIONS ED doctors show a high level of agreement when determining the location of J-points and measuring the magnitude of ST elevation at those J-points on ECGs of patients with STEMI. The findings support the measurement of ST segment elevation at the J-point in STEMI cases and should be regarded as a consistent standard to avoid confusion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Atrioventricular-nodal-reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that is relatively common in the emergency department (ED). It is rarely indicative of underlying electrical or structural pathology. OBJECTIVE This review evaluates the literature and controversies concerning treatment of AVNRT in the ED. DISCUSSION For treatment of narrow-complex tachycardia, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines recommend the use of vagal maneuvers, followed by adenosine. Recent literature suggests that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem, may be as effective as adenosine, without the negative short-term side effects. Multiple studies have demonstrated that although adenosine is rapid acting, there is no statistically significant difference in conversion rate between adenosine and calcium channel blockers. Both medications result in a conversion rate above 90\%, but there are significantly more minor adverse effects, such as flushing or chest discomfort, with adenosine. Calcium channel blockers are a viable option for treatment for AVNRT, especially in refractory states. Beta-blockers have been evaluated but should not be used routinely due to lower efficacy. AVNRT is the most common tachydysrhythmia in pregnancy, and vagal maneuvers and adenosine are first line. Electrical cardioversion should be utilized for hemodynamically unstable patients. Most patients with AVNRT may be discharged with appropriate follow-up. CONCLUSION Several studies demonstrate that nondihydropyridine calcium channels (verapamil and diltiazem) are equally as efficacious as adenosine in converting AVNRT to sinus rhythm, without the negative (albeit short-lived) side effects. If given over 20 min, the risk for hypotension is low.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE Targeted temperature management (TTM) improves survival with good neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but is delivered inconsistently and often with delay. OBJECTIVE To determine if prehospital cooling by paramedics leads to higher rates of 'successful TTM', defined as achieving a target temperature of 32-34°C within 6h of hospital arrival. METHODS Pragmatic RCT comparing prehospital cooling (surface ice packs, cold saline infusion, wristband reminders) initiated 5min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) versus usual resuscitation and transport. The primary outcome was rate of 'successful TTM'; secondary outcomes were rates of applying TTM in hospital, survival with good neurological outcome, pulmonary edema in emergency department, and re-arrest during transport. RESULTS 585 patients were randomized to receive prehospital cooling (n=279) or control (n=306). Prehospital cooling did not increase rates of 'successful TTM' (30\% vs 25\%; RR, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.52; p=0.22), but increased rates of applying TTM in hospital (68\% vs 56\%; RR, 1.21; 95\%CI 1.07-1.37; p=0.003). Survival with good neurological outcome (29\% vs 26\%; RR, 1.13, 95\%CI 0.87-1.47; p=0.37) was similar. Prehospital cooling was not associated with re-arrest during transport (7.5\% vs 8.2\%; RR, 0.94; 95\%CI 0.54-1.63; p=0.83) but was associated with decreased incidence of pulmonary edema in emergency department (12\% vs 18\%; RR, 0.66; 95\%CI 0.44-0.99; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Prehospital cooling initiated 5min after ROSC did not increase rates of achieving a target temperature of 32-34°C within 6h of hospital arrival but was safe and increased application of TTM in hospital.},

However, there is a paucity of evidence to support this practice. This study analyzes the association between specific hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities and the development of short-term adverse events in patients with severe hyperkalemia. METHODS We collected records of all adult patients with potassium (K+) ≥6.5 mEq/L in the hospital laboratory database from August 15, 2010, through January 30, 2015. A chart review identified patient demographics, concurrent laboratory values, ECG within one hour of K+ measurement, treatments and occurrence of adverse events within six hours of ECG. We defined adverse events as symptomatic bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or death. Two emergency physicians blinded to study objective independently examined each ECG for rate, rhythm, peaked T wave, PR interval duration and QRS complex duration. Relative risk was calculated to determine the association between specific hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities and short-term adverse events. RESULTS We included a total of 188 patients with severe hyperkalemia in the final study group. Adverse events occurred within six hours in 28 patients (15\%): symptomatic bradycardia (n=22), death (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=2) and CPR (n=2). All adverse events occurred prior to treatment with calcium and all but one occurred prior to K+-lowering intervention. All patients who had a short-term adverse event had a preceding ECG that demonstrated at least one hyperkalemic abnormality (100\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] [85.7-100\%]). An increased likelihood of short-term adverse event was found for hyperkalemic patients whose ECG demonstrated QRS prolongation (relative risk [RR] 4.74, 95\% CI [2.01-11.15]), bradycardia (HR{\textless}50) (RR 12.29, 95\%CI [6.69-22.57]), and/or junctional rhythm (RR 7.46, 95\%CI 5.28-11.13). There was no statistically significant correlation between peaked T waves and short-term adverse events (RR 0.77, 95\% CI [0.35-1.70]). CONCLUSION Our findings support the use of the ECG to risk stratify patients with severe hyperkalemia for short-term adverse events.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Airway management is vitally important in the management of critically ill and injured patients. Current tools to predict the difficult airway have limited application in the emergency airway situation. The aim of this study was to derive a novel difficult airway prediction tool for emergency intubation. METHODS A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed in a population of air medical rapid sequence intubation patients requiring more than 1 attempt. The Delphi technique was used to classify the etiology for airway failure as reported by providers as part of a performance improvement database. Etiologies were organized into 6 categories, and an acronym was derived for ease of recall. RESULTS A total of 504 patients were screened, with 63 (12\%) patients identified in whom the initial intubation attempt was unsuccessful. All 63 patients (100\%) were placed into 1 or more categories (HEAVEN criteria = Hypoxemia, Extremes of size, Anatomic challenges, Vomit/blood/fluid, Exsanguination/anemia, and Neck mobility issues). The database was relatively modest in size, and many patients had more than 1 criterion present, limiting our ability to perform prevalence calculations. CONCLUSION The HEAVEN criteria represent a set of difficult airway predictors that may be applied prospectively by emergency airway personnel, facilitating airway decision making. These criteria should be validated prospectively.},

We perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the predictive utility of the tGCS versus the mGCS or Simplified Motor Scale in field triage of trauma for identifying patients with adverse outcomes (inhospital mortality or severe brain injury) or who underwent procedures (neurosurgical intervention or emergency intubation) indicating need for high-level trauma care. Methods Ovid MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and the Cochrane databases were searched through June 2016 for English-language cohort studies. We included studies that compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the tGCS versus the mGCS or Simplified Motor Scale assessed in the field or shortly after arrival in the emergency department for predicting the outcomes described above. Meta-analyses were performed with a random-effects model, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results We included 18 head-to-head studies of predictive utility (n=1,703,388). For inhospital mortality, the tGCS was associated with slightly greater discrimination than the mGCS (pooled mean difference in [AUROC] 0.015; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.009 to 0.022; I2=85\%; 12 studies) or the Simplified Motor Scale (pooled mean difference in AUROC 0.030; 95\% CI 0.024 to 0.036; I2=0\%; 5 studies). The tGCS was also associated with greater discrimination than the mGCS or Simplified Motor Scale for nonmortality outcomes (differences in AUROC from 0.03 to 0.05). Findings were robust in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusion The tGCS is associated with slightly greater discrimination than the mGCS or Simplified Motor Scale for identifying severe trauma. The small differences in discrimination are likely to be clinically unimportant and could be offset by factors such as convenience and ease of use.},

	abstract = {Objective Early death following cranial trauma is often considered unsurvivable traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, Impact Brain Apnoea (IBA), the phenomenon of apnoea following TBI, may be a significant and preventable contributor to death attributed to primary injury. This paper reviews the history of IBA, cites case examples and reports a survey of emergency responder experience. Methods Literature and narrative review and focused survey of pre-hospital physicians. Results IBA was first reported in the medical literature in 1705 but has been demonstrated in multiple animal studies and is frequently anecdotally witnessed in the pre-hospital arena following human TBI. It is characterised by the cessation of spontaneous breathing following a TBI and is commonly accompanied by a catecholamine surge witnessed as hypertension followed by cardiovascular collapse. This contradicts the belief that isolated traumatic brain injury cannot be the cause of shock, raising the possibility that brain injury may be misinterpreted and therefore mismanaged in patients with isolated brain injury. Current trauma management techniques (e.g. rolling patients supine, compression only cardiopulmonary resuscitation) could theoretically compound hypoxia and worsen the effects of IBA. Anecdotal examples from clinicians attending head injured patients within a few minutes of injury are described. Proposals for the study and intervention for IBA using advances in remote technology are discussed. Conclusion IBA is a potential cause of early death in some head injured patients. The precise mechanisms in humans are poorly understood but it is likely that early, simple interventions to prevent apnoea could improve clinical outcomes.},

The new rule replaces the third criterion (5 mm of excessively discordant ST elevation [STE]) with a proportion (at least 1 mm STE and STE/S wave ≤-0.25). We sought to validate the modified criteria. METHODS This retrospective case-control study was performed by chart review in 2 tertiary care center emergency departments (EDs) and 1 regional referral center. A billing database was used at 1 site to identify all ED patients with LBBB and ischemic symptoms between May 2009 and June 2012. In addition, all 3 sites identified LBBB ACO patients who underwent emergent catheterization. We measured QRS amplitude and J-point deviation in all leads, blinded to outcomes. Acute coronary occlusion was determined by angiographic findings and cardiac biomarker levels, which were collected blinded to electrocardiograms. Diagnostic statistics of each rule were calculated and compared using McNemar's test. RESULTS Our consecutive cohort search identified 258 patients: 9 had ACO, and 249 were controls. Among the 3 sites, an additional 36 cases of ACO were identified, for a total of 45 ACO cases and 249 controls. The modified criteria were significantly more sensitive than the original weighted criteria (80\% vs 49\%, P {\textless} .001) and unweighted criteria (80\% vs 56\%, P {\textless} .001). Specificity of the modified criteria was not statistically different from the original weighted criteria (99\% vs 100\%, P = .5) but was significantly greater than the original unweighted criteria (99\% vs 94\%, P = .004).

Conversely, this less life-threatening etiology of ST elevation may be confused for inferior STEMI. We sought to determine if the presence of any ST-segment depression in lead aVL would differentiate inferior STEMI from pericarditis. METHODS Retrospective study of 3 populations. Cohort 1 included patients coded as inferior STEMI, cohort 2 included patients with a discharge diagnosis of pericarditis who presented with chest pain and at least 0.5 mm of ST elevation in at least 1 inferior lead. We analyzed the presenting electrocardiogram in both populations, with careful assessment of leads II, III, aVF, and aVL. In addition, we retrospectively studied a third cohort of patients with subtle inferior STEMI ({\textless}1-mm STE with occluded artery on catheterization) and assessed the sensitivity of ST depression in lead aVL for this group. RESULTS Of 154 inferior STEMI patients, 154 had some amount of ST depression in lead aVL (100\%; confidence interval, 98\%-100\%). Of the 49 electrocardiograms in the pericarditis group, all 49 had some inferior STE but none had any ST-segment depression in lead aVL (specificity, 100\%; confidence interval, 91\%-100\%). In the third cohort, there were 272 inferior MIs with coronary occlusion, of which 54 were "subtle." Of these, 49 had some ST depression in lead aVL. CONCLUSION When there is inferior ST-segment elevation, the presence of any ST depression in lead aVL is highly sensitive for coronary occlusion in inferior myocardial infarction and very specific for differentiating inferior myocardial infarction from pericarditis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Scarce literature exists describing the patterns of readmission after continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. These carry significant cost and quality of life implications. We sought to describe the etiology and pattern of readmission among patients receiving CF-LVADs. METHODS Frequency, reason, urgency, and duration of readmission as well as freedom from readmission were examined in a retrospective review of our institutional experience. As an indirect means of quality of life, the ratio of days out of hospital (OOH)/days alive with device was calculated. RESULTS From 2006 to 2011, 71 adult patients implanted with a CF device were included. Indication for device implantation was bridge to transplant (n=19), potential bridge to transplant (n=25), or destination therapy (n=27). Length of support averaged 359 days. Total support time was 69.7 patient years. One hundred fifty-five readmissions accounted for a total of 1,659 hospital days. Fifty-six patients were readmitted during the study period. Median time to first readmission was 48 days (range 2 to 663 days). Median length of stay was 5 days. The single most common etiology for readmission was gastrointestinal bleeding accounting for 14\% of readmissions. Readmissions were urgent (87\%), elective (10\%), or life-threatening (3\%). Patients on the average enjoyed 92\% of their time OOH. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing CF-LVAD support are often readmitted within 6 months of discharge. Readmissions tend to be of short duration and the most common reason is for gastrointestinal bleeding. Importantly, following discharge after implant procedure, 51 patients spent at least 90\% of days OOH.},

Hospital readmission is an important measure of the intensity of LVAD support care. We analyzed readmissions of 148 patients (mean age, 53.6 ± 12.7 yr; 83\% male) who received a HeartMate II LVAD from April 2008 through June 2012. The patients had severe heart failure; 60.1\% were in Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class 1 or 2. All patients were observed for at least 12 months, and readmissions were classified as planned or unplanned. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify predictors of unplanned readmission. Twenty-seven patients (18.2\%) had no readmissions or 69 planned readmissions, and 121 patients (81.8\%) had 460 unplanned readmissions. The LVAD-related readmissions were for bleeding, thrombosis, and anticoagulation (n=103; 49.1\%), pump-related infections (n=60; 28.6\%), and neurologic events (n=28; 13.3\%). The readmission rate was 2.1 per patient-year. Unplanned readmissions were for comorbidities and underlying cardiac disease (54.3\%) or LVAD-related causes (45.7\%). In the unplanned-readmission rate, there was no significant difference between bridge-to-transplantation and destination-therapy patients. Unplanned readmissions were associated with diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR]=3.3; P=0.04) and with shorter mileage from residence to hospital (OR=0.998; P=0.046). Unplanned admissions for LVAD-related sequelae and ongoing comorbidities were common. Diabetes mellitus and shorter distance from residence to hospital were significant predictors of readmission. We project that improved management of comorbidities and of anticoagulation therapy will reduce unplanned readmissions of LVAD patients in the future.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and causes of readmissions after implantation of axial flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Background: Based on the REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) study experience, readmissions after LVAD implantation are thought to be frequent. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed admissions to our facility in a cohort of 115 patients implanted between January 2008 and July 2011 with the HeartMate II axial flow LVAD, of whom 42 were bridged to transplant. To account for repeated events, Andersen-Gill models were used to determine possible predictors. Results: The patients were followed for 1.4 ?? 0.9 years. There were 224 readmissions in 83 patients. The overall readmission rate was 1.64 ?? 1.97 per patient-year of follow-up. The readmission rate for the first 6 months was 2.0 ?? 2.3 and decreased to 1.2 ?? 2.1 during subsequent follow-up. Leading causes were bleeding (66 readmissions in 34 patients), mostly gastrointestinal bleed (51 in 27 patients), cardiac (51 in 36 patients, most for HF or arrhythmia), infections (32 in 25 patients) of which 6 were pump related, and thrombosis (20 in 15 patients) including 13 readmissions due to hemolysis. Preoperative variables associated with (fewer) readmissions in a multivariate model include residence within our hospital-extended referral zone of Minnesota and the neighboring states (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95\% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.91; p = 0.011), hemoglobin (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84 to 0.99; p = 0.027) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95\% confidence interval: 0.96 to 1.0 per 1,000-unit increase, p = 0.022). C-statistic for the model: 0.63. Conclusions: Readmission rates after axial flow LVAD implantation decrease during the first 6 months and then stabilize. The leading causes are bleeding, cardiac (heart failure and arrhythmia), infections, and thrombosis. ?? 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

We also analyzed the impact of unplanned readmissions on post-CF-LVAD survival and the costs associated with each cause of readmission. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 126 patients who underwent implantation with a CF-LVAD from January 2007 to December 2013. The timing of readmissions, hospital length of stay, and total length of device support were evaluated. Patients were followed up while receiving support, until transplantation, or until death. Direct hospital costs associated with each readmission were analyzed. RESULTS: In all, 103 patients underwent implantation for bridge to transplantation and 19 patients for destination therapy; 68 patients were readmitted 156 times (2.2 times/patient) as of the end of follow-up. The median follow-up period was 11 months. While receiving device support, patients spent 93\% of their time out of the hospital. The causes of readmission included gastrointestinal bleeding (19\%), driveline infection (13\%), and stroke (8\%). The median time to first readmission was 35 days. Thirty (44\%) patients were readmitted within 30 days after discharge. The median direct hospital cost of a single readmission was \$7,546. Device malfunction and arrhythmias were the most costly causes of readmission. There was no significant difference in long-term survival between readmitted patients and those who were not readmitted. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal bleeding and CF-LVAD-related infections were the leading causes of readmission. Patients with a CF-LVAD spent 93\% of their time out of hospital after implantation, and readmissions did not have a negative impact on long-term survival. New approaches to minimize these adverse events will continue to improve the efficacy and decrease the cost of CF-LVAD therapy.},

METHODS: A retrospective review of 88 patients implanted with a continuous-flow LVAD between June 2006 and June 2014 was performed. Reason for readmission, frequency, length of stay, and procedures performed during each readmission were recorded. All patients were followed in our LVAD clinic and all readmissions were reported to our program. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (76\%) were discharged following their hospitalization for LVAD implant. In these patients, indication for LVAD support consisted of bridge to transplant (78\%) and destination therapy (22\%). Total device support time was 30,482 days, with an average support time of 455 ± 376 days. Forty-two patients (63\%) were readmitted at least once, with an average length of readmission stay of nine days (median = 6). There were 129 readmissions totaling 1264 hospital days. The main reason for readmission was infection (17\%). Despite this relatively high readmission rate, patients spent 86\% of their time outside the hospital. CONCLUSION: Although common, LVAD readmissions can be appropriately managed with patients spending the majority of their support time at home. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12744 (J Card Surg 2016;31:361-364).},

The primary end point was the proportion of relatives with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)–related symptoms on day 90. Secondary end points included the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms and the effect of family presence on medical efforts at resuscitation, the well-being of the health care team, and the occurrence of medicolegal claims.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose Automated measurements of electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals are widely used by clinicians for individual patient diagnosis and by investigators in population studies. We examined whether clinically significant systematic differences exist in ECG intervals measured by current generation digital electrocardiographs from different manufacturers and whether differences, if present, are dependent on the degree of abnormality of the selected ECGs. Methods Measurements of RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were made blindly by 4 major manufacturers of digital electrocardiographs used in the United States from 600 XML files of ECG tracings stored in the US FDA ECG warehouse and released for the purpose of this study by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. Included were 3 groups based on expected QT interval and degree of repolarization abnormality, comprising 200 ECGs each from (1) placebo or baseline study period in normal subjects during thorough QT studies, (2) peak moxifloxacin effect in otherwise normal subjects during thorough QT studies, and (3) patients with genotyped variants of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Results Differences of means between manufacturers were generally small in the normal and moxifloxacin subjects, but in the LQTS patients, differences of means ranged from 2.0 to 14.0 ms for QRS duration and from 0.8 to 18.1 ms for the QT interval. Mean absolute differences between algorithms were similar for QRS duration and QT intervals in the normal and in the moxifloxacin subjects (mean ≤6 ms) but were significantly larger in patients with LQTS. Conclusions Small but statistically significant group differences in mean interval and duration measurements and means of individual absolute differences exist among automated algorithms of widely used, current generation digital electrocardiographs. Measurement differences, including QRS duration and the QT interval, are greatest for the most abnormal ECGs. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the most common diagnoses assigned to emergency department (ED) patients who are hospitalized. Despite its high prevalence in the emergency setting, the diagnosis of AHF in ED patients with undifferentiated dyspnea can be challenging.


Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the operating characteristics of diagnostic elements available to the emergency physician for diagnosing AHF. Secondary objectives were to develop a test–treatment threshold model and to calculate interval likelihood ratios (LRs) for natriuretic peptides (NPs) by pooling patient-level results.


Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and selected bibliographies were searched from January 1965 to March 2015 using MeSH terms to address the ability of the following index tests to predict AHF as a cause of dyspnea in adult patients in the ED: history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph (CXR), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), lung ultrasound (US), bedside echocardiography, and bioimpedance. A diagnosis of AHF based on clinical data combined with objective test results served as the criterion standard diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Meta-DiSc software. Authors of all NP studies were contacted to obtain patient-level data. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) for systematic reviews was utilized to evaluate the quality and applicability of the studies included.


Results

Based on the included studies, the prevalence of AHF ranged from 29\% to 79\%. Index tests with pooled positive LRs ≥ 4 were the auscultation of S3 on physical examination (4.0, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7 to 5.9), pulmonary edema on both CXR (4.8, 95\% CI = 3.6 to 6.4) and lung US (7.4, 95\% CI = 4.2 to 12.8), and reduced ejection fraction observed on bedside echocardiogram (4.1, 95\% CI = 2.4 to 7.2). Tests with low negative LRs were BNP {\textless} 100 pg/mL (0.11, 95\% CI = 0.07 to 0.16), NT-proBNP {\textless} 300 pg/mL (0.09, 95\% CI = 0.03 to 0.34), and B-line pattern on lung US LR (0.16, 95\% CI = 0.05 to 0.51). Interval LRs of BNP concentrations at the low end of “positive” results as defined by a cutoff of 100 pg/mL were substantially lower (100 to 200 pg/mL; 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.38) than those associated with higher BNP concentrations (1000 to 1500 pg/mL; 7.12, 95\% CI = 4.53 to 11.18). The interval LR of NT-proBNP concentrations even at very high values (30,000 to 200,000 pg/mL) was 3.30 (95\% CI = 2.05 to 5.31).


Conclusions

Bedside lung US and echocardiography appear to the most useful tests for affirming the presence of AHF while NPs are valuable in excluding the diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The appropriate management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) depends on accurate interpretation of the 12-lead ECG by paramedics. Computer interpretation messages on ECGs are often provided, but the effect they exert on paramedics' decision-making is not known. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online assessment tool, and collect pilot data, for a definitive trial to determine the effect of computer interpretation messages on paramedics' diagnosis of STEMI.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: The Recognition of STEMI by Paramedics and the Effect of Computer inTerpretation (RESPECT) feasibility study was a randomised crossover trial using a bespoke, web-based assessment tool. Participants were randomly allocated 12 of 48 ECGs, with an equal mix of correct and incorrect computer interpretation messages, and STEMI and STEMI-mimics. The nature of the responses required a cross-classified multi-level model.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: 254 paramedics consented into the study, 205 completing the first phase and 150 completing phase two. The adjusted OR for a correct paramedic interpretation, when the computer interpretation was correct (true positive for STEMI or true negative for STEMI-mimic), was 1.80 (95\% CI 0.84 to 4.91) and 0.58 (95\% CI 0.41 to 0.81) when the computer interpretation was incorrect (false positive for STEMI or false negative for STEMI-mimic). The intraclass correlation coefficient for correct computer interpretations was 0.33 for participants and 0.17 for ECGs, and for incorrect computer interpretations, 0.06 for participants and 0.01 for ECGs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Determining the effect of computer interpretation messages using a web-based assessment tool is feasible, but the design needs to take clustered data into account. Pilot data suggest that computer messages influence paramedic interpretation, improving accuracy when correct and worsening accuracy when incorrect.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sgarbossa's rule, proposed for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, has had suboptimal diagnostic utility. We hypothesize that a revised rule, in which the third Sgarbossa component (excessively discordant ST-segment elevation as defined by ≥5 mm of ST-segment elevation in the setting of a negative QRS) is replaced by one defined proportionally by ST-segment elevation to S-wave depth (ST/S ratio), will have better diagnostic utility for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent, using documented coronary occlusion on angiography as reference standard.

METHODS: We collected admission ECGs for all patients with an acutely occluded coronary artery and left bundle branch block at 3 institutions. The ECGs of emergency department patients with chest pain or dyspnea and left bundle branch block, but without coronary occlusion, were used as controls. The R or S wave, whichever was most prominent, and ST segments, relative to the PR segment, were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The ST/S ratio was calculated for each lead that has both discordant ST deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm and an R or S wave of opposite polarity; others were set to 0. The cut point for the most negative ST/S ratio with at least 90\% specificity was determined. The revised rule is unweighted, requiring just 1 of 3 criteria. Diagnostic utilities of the original and revised Sgarbossa rules were computed and compared. McNemar's test was used to compare sensitivities and specificities.

RESULTS: The study and control groups included 33 and 129 ECGs, respectively. The cut point selected for relative discordant ST-segment elevation was -0.25. Excessive absolute discordant ST-segment elevation of 5 mm was present in at least one lead in 30\% of ECGs in patients with confirmed coronary occlusion versus 9\% of the control group, whereas excessive relative discordant ST-segment elevation less than -0.25 was present in 79\% vs. 9\% [corrected].Sensitivity of the revised rule in which ST-segment elevation with an ST/S ratio less than or equal to -0.25 replaces ST-segment elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm was significantly greater than either the weighted (P{\textless}.001) or unweighted (P=.008) Sgarbossa rule: 91\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 76\% to 98\%) versus 52\% (95\% CI 34\% to 69\%) versus 67\% (95\% CI 48\% to 82\%). Specificity of the revised rule was lower than that of the weighted rule (P=.002) and similar to that of the unweighted rule (P=1.0): 90\% (95\% CI 83\% to 95\%) versus 98\% (95\% CI 93\% to 100\%) versus 90\% (95\% CI 83\% to 95\%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios for the revised rule were 9.0 (95\% CI 8.0 to 10) and 0.1 (95\% CI 0.03 to 0.3). The revised rule was significantly more accurate than both the weighted (16\% difference; 95\% CI 5\% to 27\%) and unweighted (12\% difference; 95\% CI 2\% to 22\%) Sgarbossa rules.

CONCLUSION: Replacement of the absolute ST-elevation measurement of greater than or equal to 5 mm in the third component of the Sgarbossa rule with an ST/S ratio less than -0.25 greatly improves diagnostic utility of the rule for STEMI. An unweighted rule using this criterion resulted in excellent prediction for acute coronary occlusion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Mechanical chest compression devices have the potential to help maintain high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but despite their increasing use, little evidence exists for their effectiveness. We aimed to study whether the introduction of LUCAS-2 mechanical CPR into front-line emergency response vehicles would improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS The pre-hospital randomised assessment of a mechanical compression device in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC) trial was a pragmatic, cluster-randomised open-label trial including adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from four UK Ambulance Services (West Midlands, North East England, Wales, South Central). 91 urban and semi-urban ambulance stations were selected for participation. Clusters were ambulance service vehicles, which were randomly assigned (1:2) to LUCAS-2 or manual CPR. Patients received LUCAS-2 mechanical chest compression or manual chest compressions according to the first trial vehicle to arrive on scene. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days following cardiac arrest and was analysed by intention to treat. Ambulance dispatch staff and those collecting the primary outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Masking of the ambulance staff who delivered the interventions and reported initial response to treatment was not possible. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN08233942. FINDINGS We enrolled 4471 eligible patients (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group) between April 15, 2010 and June 10, 2013. 985 (60\%) patients in the LUCAS-2 group received mechanical chest compression, and 11 ({\textless}1\%) patients in the control group received LUCAS-2. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 30 day survival was similar in the LUCAS-2 group (104 [6\%] of 1652 patients) and in the manual CPR group (193 [7\%] of 2819 patients; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·86, 95\% CI 0·64-1·15). No serious adverse events were noted. Seven clinical adverse events were reported in the LUCAS-2 group (three patients with chest bruising, two with chest lacerations, and two with blood in mouth). 15 device incidents occurred during operational use. No adverse or serious adverse events were reported in the manual group. INTERPRETATION We noted no evidence of improvement in 30 day survival with LUCAS-2 compared with manual compressions. On the basis of ours and other recent randomised trials, widespread adoption of mechanical CPR devices for routine use does not improve survival.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can be difficult to differentiate from early repolarization on the ECG. We hypothesize that, in addition to ST-segment elevation, T-wave amplitude to R-wave amplitude ratio (T-wave amplitude(avg)/R-wave amplitude(avg)), and R-wave amplitude in leads V2 to V4, computerized corrected QT interval (QTc) and upward concavity would help to differentiate the 2. We seek to determine which ECG measurements best distinguish STEMI versus early repolarization.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with anterior STEMI (2003 to 2009) and early repolarization (2003 to 2005) at 2 urban hospitals, one of which (Minneapolis Heart Institute) receives 500 STEMI patients per year. We compared the ECGs of nonobvious ("subtle") anterior STEMI with emergency department noncardiac chest pain patients with early repolarization. ST-segment elevation at the J point and 60 ms after the J point, T-wave amplitude, R-wave amplitude, QTc, upward concavity, J-wave notching, and T waves in V1 and V6 were measured. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify ECG measurements independently predictive of STEMI versus early repolarization in a derivation group and was subsequently validated in a separate group.

RESULTS: Of 355 anterior STEMIs identified, 143 were nonobvious, or subtle, compared with 171 early repolarization ECGs. ST-segment elevation was greater, R-wave amplitude lower, and T-wave amplitude(avg)/R-wave amplitude(avg) higher in leads V2 to V4 with STEMI versus early repolarization. Computerized QTc was also significantly longer with STEMI versus early repolarization. T-wave amplitude did not differ significantly between the groups, such that the T-wave amplitude(avg)/R-wave amplitude(avg) difference was entirely due to the difference in R-wave amplitude. An ECG criterion based on 3 measurements (R-wave amplitude in lead V4, ST-segment elevation 60 ms after J-point in lead V3, and QTc) was derived and validated for differentiating STEMI versus early repolarization, such that if the value of the equation ([1.196 x ST-segment elevation 60 ms after the J point in lead V3 in mm]+[0.059 x QTc in ms]-[0.326 x R-wave amplitude in lead V4 in mm]) is greater than 23.4 predicted STEMI and if less than or equal to 23.4, it predicted early repolarization in both groups, with overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 79, 91), 91\% (95\% CI 85, 95), and 88\% (95\% CI 84, 92), respectively, with positive likelihood ratio 9.2 (95\% CI 8.5 to 10) and negative likelihood ratio 0.1 (95\% CI 0.08 to 0.3). Upward concavity, upright T wave in V1 or T wave, in V1 greater than T wave in V6, and J-wave notching did not provide important information.

CONCLUSION: R-wave amplitude is lower, ST-segment elevation greater, and QTc longer for subtle anterior STEMI versus early repolarization. In combination with other clinical data, this derived and validated ECG equation could be an important adjunct in the diagnosis of anterior STEMI.},

	abstract = {Misplacement of electrodes can change the morphology of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in clinical important ways. To assess the frequency of these errors in different clinical settings, we collected ECGs routinely performed at the cardiology outpatient clinic and the intensive care unit. Lead misplacement was suspected when one of the following morphological changes occurred: QRS axis between 180?? and -90??, positive P wave in lead aVR, negative P waves in lead I and/or II, very low ({\textless}0.1 mV) amplitude in an isolated peripheral lead, or abnormal R progression in the precordial leads. We analyzed 838 ECGs and identified 37 ECGs suspicious for electrode misplacement, from which 7 were confirmed. The frequency of ECG artifacts due to switched electrodes was 0.4\% (3/739) at the outpatient clinic and 4.0\% (4/99) at the intensive care unit (P = .005). In conclusion, errors in ECG performance do occur with an increasing frequency in an acute medical care setting. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many prehospital protocols require acquisition of a single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) when assessing a patient for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, it is known that ECG evidence of STEMI can evolve over time.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVES: To determine how often the first and, if necessary, second or third prehospital ECGs identified STEMI, and the time intervals associated with acquiring these ECGs and arrival at the emergency department (ED).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 325 consecutive prehospital STEMIs identified between June 2008 and May 2009 in a large third-service emergency medical services (EMS) system. If the first ECG did not identify STEMI, protocol required a second ECG just before transport and, if necessary, a third ECG before entering the receiving ED. Paramedics who identified STEMI at any time bypassed participating local EDs, taking patients directly to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center. Paramedics used computerized ECG interpretation with STEMI diagnosis defined as an "acute MI" report by GE/Marquette 12-SL software in ZOLL E-series defibrillator/cardiac monitors (ZOLL Medical, Chelmsford, MA). We recorded the time of each ECG, and the ordinal number of the diagnostic ECG. We then determined the number of cases and frequency of STEMI diagnosis on the first, second, or third ECG. We also measured the interval between ECGs and the interval from the initial positive ECG to arrival at the ED. Results. STEMI was identified on the first prehospital ECG in 275 cases, on the second ECG in 30 cases, and on the third ECG in 20 cases (cumulative percentages of 84.6\%, 93.8\%, and 100\%, respectively). For STEMIs identified on the second or third ECG, 90\% were identified within 25 minutes after the first ECG. The median times from identification of STEMI to arrival at the ED were 17.5 minutes, 11.0 minutes, and 0.7 minutes for STEMIs identified on the first, second, and third ECGs, respectively.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: A single prehospital ECG would have identified only 84.6\% of STEMI patients. This suggests caution using a single prehospital ECG to rule out STEMI. Three serial ECGs acquired over 25 minutes is feasible and may be valuable in maximizing prehospital diagnostic yield, particularly where emergent access to PCI exists.},

	abstract = {Background Treatment times for primary percutaneous coronary intervention frequently exceed the recommended maximum delay. Automated “physicianless” systems of prehospital cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation show promise, but have been met with resistance over concerns regarding the potential for false positive and inappropriate activations (IAs). Methods From 2010 to 2015, first responders performed electrocardiograms (ECGs) in the field for all patients with a complaint of chest pain or dyspnea. An automated machine diagnosis of “acute myocardial infarction” resulted in immediate CCL activation and direct transfer without transmission or human reinterpretation of the ECG prior to patient arrival. Any activation resulting from a nondiagnostic ECG (no ST-elevation) was deemed an IA, whereas activations resulting from ECG's compatible with ST-elevation myocardial infarction but without angiographic evidence of a coronary event were deemed false positive. In 2012, the referral algorithm was modified to exclude supraventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. Results There were 155 activations in the early cohort (2010-2012; prior to algorithm modification) and 313 in the late cohort (2012-2015). Algorithm modification resulted in a 42\% relative decrease in the rate of IAs (12\% vs 7\%; P {\textless} 0.01) without a significant effect on treatment delay. Conclusions A combination of prehospital automated ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis and “physicianless” CCL activation is safe and effective in improving treatment delay and these results are sustainable over time. The performance of the referral algorithm in terms of IA and false positive is at least on par with systems that ensure real-time human oversight.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid reperfusion of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves outcomes. Systems have been developed in many areas to identify STEMI patients in the field using pre-hospital electrocardiograms (ECGs). The Zoll E-Series (ES) is a defibrillator/monitoring system that utilizes the GE Medical Systems 12SL interpretive algorithm to assist with identification of STEMIs. There is a lack of significant data measuring the accuracy of the Zoll ES and its algorithm, especially in the setting of a large urban population. Methods: We retrospectively looked at 307 consecutive ECGs transmitted by one emergency medical service (EMS) provider to an urban primary PCI facility from October 2009 to January 2011. All transmissions were from Zoll ES monitors. Multiple ECG computer interpretations were screened and filtered out to those labeled nullnullnullACUTE MInullnullnull. A retrospective chart review was performed to determine the clinical outcome for each transmission in order to determine the performance of the interpretive algorithm in this population. Results: Overall, 307 ECGs were analyzed. A total of 7\% (20 of 307) were confirmed STEMIs (Table 1). The computer reading shows a sensitivity of 95\% (20 of 21) and specificity of 94\% (268 of 286). There is a positive predictive value (PPV) of 53\% (20 of 38). Conclusions: The initial data from this study shows that the Zoll ES has a remarkably high sensitivity of 95\% but a poor PPV of 53\%. This may be due to multiple confounders that result in STEMI nullmimics.null The Zoll ES helps provide a pre-hospital ECG that serves as a powerful and life saving tool in the field. However, due to the low PPV, these findings reinforce that the pre-hospital ECG needs to be combined with an appropriate clinical history and additional human interpretation. Further studies analyzing a larger population of patients should be conducted to further assess the value of using this tool.},

	abstract = {Introduction The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) presents a plethora of information and demands extensive knowledge and a high cognitive workload to interpret. Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. Methods An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). Results For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45\%; SD = 18.1\%; CI = 42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85\% (SD = 42.4\%; CI = 49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4\%. (CI = 4.45, 22.35) An N − 1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92\% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p = 0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. Conclusions We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The purpose of the project was to study the impact that immediate physician electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation would have on door-to-balloon times in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as compared with computer-interpreted ECGs. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 340 consecutive patients from September 2003 to December 2009 with STEMI who underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the computer-interpreted ECG interpretation: those with acute myocardial infarction identified by the computer interpretation and those not identified as acute myocardial infarction. Patients (n = 173) from September 2003 to June 2006 had their initial ECG reviewed by the triage nurse, while patients from July 2006 to December 2009 (n = 167) had their ECG reviewed by the emergency department physician within 10 minutes. Times for catheterization laboratory activation and percutaneous coronary intervention were recorded in all patients. RESULTS Of the 340 patients with confirmed STEMI, 102 (30\%) patients were not identified by computer interpretation. Comparing the prior protocol of computer ECG to physician interpretation, the latter resulted in significant improvements in median catheterization laboratory activation time \{19 minutes [interquartile range (IQR): 10-37] vs. 16 minutes [IQR: 8-29]; P {\textless} 0.029\} and in median door-to-balloon time [113 minutes (IQR: 86-143) vs. 85 minutes (IQR: 62-106); P {\textless} 0.001]. CONCLUSION The computer-interpreted ECG failed to identify a significant number of patients with STEMI. The immediate review of ECGs by an emergency physician led to faster activation of the catheterization laboratory, and door-to-balloon times in patients with STEMI.},

	abstract = {Introduction Precordial normal variant ST elevation (NV-STE), previously often called “early repolarization,” may be difficult to differentiate from subtle ischemic STE due to left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion. We previously derived and validated a logistic regression formula that was far superior to STE alone for differentiating the two entities on the ECG. The tool uses R-wave amplitude in lead V4 (RAV4), ST elevation at 60 ms after the J-point in lead V3 (STE60V3) and the computerized Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTc-B). The 3-variable formula is: 1.196 x STE60V3 + 0.059 × QTc-B – 0.326 × RAV4 with a value ≥23.4 likely to be acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Hypothesis Adding QRS voltage in V2 (QRSV2) would improve the accuracy of the formula. Methods 355 consecutive cases of proven LAD occlusion were reviewed, and those that were obvious ST elevation myocardial infarction were excluded. Exclusion was based on one straight or convex ST segment in V2-V6, 1 millimeter of summed inferior ST depression, any anterior ST depression, Q-waves, “terminal QRS distortion,” or any ST elevation {\textgreater}5 mm. The NV-STE group comprised emergency department patients with chest pain who ruled out for AMI by serial troponins, had a cardiologist ECG read of “NV-STE,” and had at least 1 mm of STE in V2 and V3. R-wave amplitude in lead V4 (RAV4), ST elevation at 60 ms after the J-point in lead V3 (STE60V3) and the computerized Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTc-B) had previously been measured in all ECGs; physicians blinded to outcome then measured QRSV2 in all ECGs. A 4-variable formula was derived to more accurately classify LAD occlusion vs. NV-STE and optimize area under the curve (AUC) and compared with the previous 3-variable formula. Results There were 143 subtle LAD occlusions and 171 NV-STE. A low QRSV2 added diagnostic utility. The derived 4-variable formula is: 0.052QTc-B - 0.151QRSV2 - 0.268RV4 + 1.062STE60V3. The 3-variable formula had an AUC of 0.9538 vs. 0.9686 for the 4-variable formula (p = 0.0092). At the same specificity as the 3-variable formula [90.6\%, at which cutpoint (≥23.4), 123 of 143 MI were correctly classified for 86\% sensitivity], the sensitivity of the new formula at cutpoint ≥17.75 is 90.2\%, with 129/143 correctly classified MI, identifying an additional 6 cases. The cutpoint with the highest accuracy (92.0\%) was at a cutoff value ≥18.2, with 88.8\% sensitivity, 94.7\% specificity, and a positive and negative likelihood ratio of 16.9 (95\% CI: 8.9–32) and 0.12 (95\% CI: 0.07–0.19). At this cutpoint, it correctly classified an additional 11 cases (289 of 315, vs. 278 of 315): 127/143 for MI (an additional 4 cases) and 162/171 for NV-STE (an additional 7 cases). Conclusion On the ECG, a 4-variable formula was derived which adds QRSV2; it differentiates subtle LAD occlusion from NV-STE better than the 3-variable formula. At a value ≥18.2, the formula (0.052QTc-B - 0.151QRSV2 - 0.268RV4 + 1.062STE60V3) was very accurate, sensitive, and specific, with excellent positive and negative likelihood ratios. This formula needs to be validated.},

While many paramedics are trained to obtain and interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs), it is unknown how accurately they can identify STEMIs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated paramedics' accuracy in recognizing STEMI on ECGs when faced with potential STEMI mimics.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: This was a descriptive cohort study using a survey administered to paramedics. The survey contained questions about training, experience, and confidence, along with 10 ECGs: three demonstrating STEMIs (inferior, anterior, and lateral), two with normal results, and five STEMI mimics (left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH], ventricular pacing, left and right bundle branch blocks [LBBB, RBBB], and supraventricular tachycardia [SVT]). We calculated the overall sensitivity and specificity and the proportion correct with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We obtained 472 surveys from 30 municipal emergency medical services (EMS) agencies in five counties with 15 medical directors from seven hospitals. The majority (69\%) reported ECG training within the preceding year, 31\% within six months; and 74\% were confident in recognizing STEMIs. The overall sensitivity and specificity for STEMI detection were 75\% and 53\% (95\% CI 73\%-77\%, 51\%-55\%), respectively. Ninety-six percent (453/472, 95\% CI 94\%-98\%) correctly identified the inferior myocardial infarction (MI), but only 78\% (368/472, 94\% CI 74\%-82\%) identified the anterior MI and 51\% (241/472, 46\%-56\%) the lateral MI. Thirty-seven percent (173/472, 95\% CI 32\%-41\%) of the paramedics correctly recognized LVH, 39\% (184/472, 95\% CI 35\%-44\%) LBBB, and 53\% (249/472, 95\% CI 48\%-57\%) ventricular pacing as not a STEMI. Thirty-nine percent (185/472, 95\% CI 35\%-44\%) correctly identified all three STEMIs; however, only 3\% of the paramedics were correct in all interpretations. The two normal ECGs were recognized as not a STEMI by 97\% (459/472, 95\% CI 95\%-99\%) and 100\% (472/472, 95\% CI 99\%-100\%). There was no correlation between training, experience, or confidence and accuracy in recognizing STEMIs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Despite training and a high level of confidence, the paramedics in our study were only able to identify an inferior STEMI and two normal ECGs. Given the paramedics' low sensitivity and specificity, we cannot rely solely on their ECG interpretation to activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Future research should involve the evaluation of training programs that include assessment, initial training, testing, feedback, and repeat training.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite attention directed at treatment times of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), little is known about the types of STEMIs presenting to the emergency department (ED).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative frequencies and characteristics of emergency medical services (EMS) STEMIs compared with those in patients who present to the ED by walk-in. This information may be applied in EMS training, system planning, and public education.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: This was a query of a prospectively gathered database of all STEMIs in patients presenting to Summa Akron City Hospital ED in 2009 and 2010. We collected demographic information, chief complaint, mode and time of arrival, and STEMI pattern (anterior, lateral, inferior, or posterior). We excluded transfers and in-hospital STEMIs. We calculated means, percentages, significance, and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) ± 10\%.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We analyzed data from 308 patients. Most patients (241/308, 78\%, CI 73\%-83\%) arrived by EMS, were male (203/308, 66\%, CI 60\%-71\%), and were white (286/308, 93\%, CI 89\%-96\%). Patients arriving by EMS were older (average 63 years, range 35-95) than walk-in patients (average 57 years, range 24-92). Two percent (5/241, 2\%, CI 1\%-5\%) of EMS STEMI patients were under 40 years of age, compared with 10\% (7/67, 10\%, CI 4\%-20\%) of walk-in patients (p = 0.0017). The most common chief complaint was chest pain (278/308, 90\%, CI 86\%-93\%). Inferior STEMIs were most common (167/308, 54\%, CI 49\%-60\%), followed by anterior (127/308, 41\%, CI 48\%-60\%), lateral (8/308, 3\%, CI 1\%-5\%), and posterior (6/308, 2\%, CI 1\%-4\%). A day-of-the-week analysis showed that no specific day was most common for STEMI presentation. Forty percent (122/308, 40\%, CI 34\%-45\%) of patients presented during open catheterization laboratory hours (Monday through Friday, 0730-1700 hours). There was no significant statistical difference between EMS and walk-in patients with regard to STEMI pattern or patient demographics.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, 95\% (294/308) of all STEMIs were inferior or anterior infarctions, and these types of presentations should be stressed in EMS education. Most STEMI patients at this institution arrived by ambulance and during off-hours. Younger patients were more likely to walk in. We need further study, but we may have identified a target population for future interventions.

Methods This single-centre retrospective pre-post study evaluated patients who were treated between January 2012 and December 2015. Some patients had received esmolol (loading dose: 500 μg/kg, infusion: 0–100 μg/kg/min) for RVF (≥3 defibrillation attempts), after obtaining consent from the patient's guardian. Results Twenty-five patients did not receive esmolol (the control group), and 16 patients received esmolol. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was significantly more common in the esmolol group, compared to the control group (56\% vs. 16\%, p = 0.007). Survival and good neurological outcomes at 30 days, 3 months and at 6 months were {\textgreater}2-fold better in the esmolol group, compared to the control group, although these increases were not statistically significant. Conclusions The findings of our study suggest that administration of esmolol may increase the rate of sustained ROSC and ICU survival among patients with RVF in OHCA. Further larger-scale, prospective studies are necessary to determine the effect of esmolol for RVF in OHCA.},

	abstract = {Aim: We studied resuscitation process metrics in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest enrolled in a randomized trial comparing one protocol designed to best use a mechanical CPR device, with another based on the 2005 European Resuscitation Council guidelines for manual CPR. Methods: We analyzed clinical data, ECG signals, and transthoracic impedance signals for a subset of the patients in the LUCAS in Cardiac Arrest (LINC) trial, including 124 patients randomized to mechanical and 82 to manual CPR. Chest compression fraction (CCF) was defined as the fraction of time during cardiac arrest that chest compressions were administered. Results: Patients in the mechanical CPR group had a higher CCF than those in the manual CPR group [0.84 (0.78, 0.91) vs. 0.79 (0.70, 0.86), p{\textless} 0.001]. The median duration of their pauses for defibrillation was also shorter [0. s (0, 6.0) vs. 10.0. s (7.0, 14.3), p{\textless} 0.001]. Compressions were interrupted for a median of 36.0. s to apply the compression device. There was no difference between groups in duration of the longest pause in compressions [32.5. s vs. 26.0. s, p=0.24], number of compressions received per minute [86.5 vs. 88.3, p=0.47], defibrillation success rate [73.2\% vs. 81.0\%, p=0.15], or refibrillation rate [74\% vs. 77\%, p=0.79]. Conclusions: A protocol using mechanical chest compression devices reduced interruptions in chest compressions, and enabled defibrillation during ongoing compressions, without adversely affecting other resuscitation process metrics. Future emphasis on optimizing device deployment may be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Aim of the study: Sternal and rib fractures are frequent complications caused by chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study aimed to investigate the potential association of CPR-related thoracic and abdominal injuries and compression depth measured with an accelerometer. Methods: We analysed the autopsy records, CT scans or chest radiographs of 170 adult patients, suffering in-hospital cardiac arrest at the Tampere University Hospital during the period 2009-2011 to investigate possible association of chest compressions and iatrogenic injuries. The quality of manual compressions during CPR was recorded on a Philips, HeartStart MRx Q-CPR™-defibrillator. Results: Patients were 110 males and 60 females. Injuries were found in 36\% of male and 23\% of female patients. Among male patients CPR-related injuries were associated with deeper mean - and peak compression depths (p{\textless}. 0.05). No such association was observed in women. The frequency of injuries in mean compression depth categories {\textless}5, 5-6 and {\textgreater}6. cm, was 28\%, 27\% and 49\% (p=0.06). Of all patients 27\% sustained rib fractures, 11\% sternal fracture and eight patients had haematomas/ruptures in the myocardium. In addition, we observed one laceration of the stomach without bleeding, one ruptured spleen, one mediastinal haemorrhage and two pneumothoraxes. Conclusion: The number of iatrogenic injuries in male patients was associated with chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation increased as the measured compression depth exceeded 6. cm. While there is an increased risk of complications with deeper compressions it is important to realize that the injuries were by and large not fatal. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Our aim was to elucidate the incidence of CPR-related injuries by manual chest compressions compared to mechanical chest compressions with the LUCAS device (mechanical CPR) in non-survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: In this prospective multicentre trial, including 222 patients (83 manual CPR/139 mechanical CPR), autopsies were conducted after unsuccessful CPR and the results were evaluated according to a specified protocol. Results: Among the patients included, 75.9\% in the manual CPR group and 91.4\% in the mechanical CPR group (p=0.002) displayed CPR-related injuries. Sternal fractures were present in 54.2\% of the patients in the manual CPR group and in 58.3\% in the mechanical CPR group (p=0.56). Of the patients in the manual CPR group, there were 64.6\% with at least one rib fracture versus 78.8\% in the mechanical CPR group (p=0.02). The median number of rib fractures among patients with rib fractures was 7 in the manual CPR group and 6 in the mechanical CPR group. No CPR-related injury was considered to be the cause of death. Conclusion: In patients with unsuccessful CPR after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, rib fractures were more frequent after mechanical CPR but there was no difference in the incidence of sternal fractures.

	abstract = {CONTEXT High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may improve both cardiac and brain resuscitation following cardiac arrest. Compared with manual chest compression, an automated load-distributing band (LDB) chest compression device produces greater blood flow to vital organs and may improve resuscitation outcomes. OBJECTIVE To compare resuscitation outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when an automated LDB-CPR device was added to standard emergency medical services (EMS) care with manual CPR. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Multicenter, randomized trial of patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States and Canada. The a priori primary population was patients with cardiac arrest that was presumed to be of cardiac origin and that had occurred prior to the arrival of EMS personnel. Initial study enrollment varied by site, ranging from late July to mid November 2004; all sites halted study enrollment on March 31, 2005. INTERVENTION Standard EMS care for cardiac arrest with an LDB-CPR device (n = 554) or manual CPR (n = 517). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was survival to 4 hours after the 911 call. Secondary end points were survival to hospital discharge and neurological status among survivors. RESULTS Following the first planned interim monitoring conducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board, study enrollment was terminated. No difference existed in the primary end point of survival to 4 hours between the manual CPR group and the LDB-CPR group overall (N = 1071; 29.5\% vs 28.5\%; P = .74) or among the primary study population (n = 767; 24.7\% vs 26.4\%, respectively; P = .62). However, among the primary population, survival to hospital discharge was 9.9\% in the manual CPR group and 5.8\% in the LDB-CPR group (P = .06, adjusted for covariates and clustering). A cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge was recorded in 7.5\% of patients in the manual CPR group and in 3.1\% of the LDB-CPR group (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS Use of an automated LDB-CPR device as implemented in this study was associated with worse neurological outcomes and a trend toward worse survival than manual CPR. Device design or implementation strategies require further evaluation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00120965.},

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7\% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0\% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2\% [95\% CI, -9.6\% to 1.1\%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4\% vs 26.1\%, respectively; difference, -3.7\% [95\% CI, -10.2\% to 2.7\%]; P = .26). Exsanguination, which was the predominant cause of death within the first 24 hours, was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2\% vs 14.6\% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -5.4\% [95\% CI, -10.4\% to -0.5\%]; P = .03). More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group (86\% vs 78\%, respectively; P = .006). Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P {\textless} .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P {\textless} .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.

Patients and Methods The study population included 1031 consecutive patients with presumed STEMI and confirmed ST-segment elevation who underwent emergent catheterization between July 1, 2008, and December 1, 2012, On July 1, 2009, we instituted an aggressive protocol to reduce DTB time. A quality improvement (QI) initiative was introduced on January 1, 2011, to maintain short DTB while improving outcomes. Outcomes were compared before and after the initiation of the DTB time protocol and similarly before and after the QI initiative. Outcomes were DTB time, the incidence of FP-STEMI, and in-hospital mortality. A review of the emergency catheterization database for the 10-year period from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010, was performed for historical comparison. Results Of the 1031 consecutive patients with presumed STEMI who were assessed, 170 were considered to have FP-STEMI. The median DTB time decreased significantly from 76 to 61 minutes with the aggressive DTB time protocol (P=.001), accompanied by an increase of FP-STEMI (7.7\% vs 16.5\%; P=.02). Although a nonsignificant reduction of in-hospital mortality occurred in patients with true-positive STEMI (P=.60), a significant increase in in-hospital mortality was seen in patients with FP-STEMI (P=.03). After the QI initiative, a shorter DTB time (59 minutes) was maintained while decreasing FP-STEMI in-hospital mortality. Conclusion Aggressive measures to reduce DTB time were associated with an increased incidence of FP-STEMI and FP-STEMI in-hospital mortality. Efforts to reduce DTB time should be monitored systematically to avoid unnecessary procedures that may delay other appropriate therapies in critically ill patients.},

In a subgroup analysis using a linked Medicare data set, we assessed 30-day mortality.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Median door-to-balloon times declined significantly, from 83 minutes in the 12 months from July 2005 through June 2006 to 67 minutes in the 12 months from July 2008 through June 2009 (P{\textless}0.001). Similarly, the percentage of patients for whom the door-to-balloon time was 90 minutes or less increased from 59.7\% in the first year to 83.1\% in the last year (P{\textless}0.001). Despite improvements in door-to-balloon times, there was no significant overall change in unadjusted in-hospital mortality (4.8\% in 2005-2006 and 4.7\% in 2008-2009, P=0.43 for trend) or in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (5.0\% in 2005-2006 and 4.7\% in 2008-2009, P=0.34), nor was a significant difference observed in unadjusted 30-day mortality (P=0.64).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Although national door-to-balloon times have improved significantly for patients undergoing primary PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, in-hospital mortality has remained virtually unchanged. These data suggest that additional strategies are needed to reduce in-hospital mortality in this population.

	abstract = {RATIONALE Hypoxemia is common during endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients and may predispose to cardiac arrest and death. Administration of supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy (apneic oxygenation) may prevent hypoxemia. OBJECTIVES To determine if apneic oxygenation increases the lowest arterial oxygen saturation experienced by patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit. METHODS A randomized, open-label, pragmatic trial in which 150 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation in a medical intensive care unit were randomized to receive 15 L/min of 100\% oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula during laryngoscopy (apneic oxygenation) or no supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy (usual care). The primary outcome was lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and two minutes after completion of endotracheal intubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Median lowest arterial oxygen saturation was 92\% with apneic oxygenation versus 90\% with usual care (95\% confidence interval for the difference -1.6\% to 7.4\%; P = .16). There was no difference between apneic oxygenation and usual care in incidence of oxygen saturation {\textless} 90\% (44.7\% versus 47.2\%; P = .87), oxygen saturation {\textless} 80\% (15.8\% versus 25.0\%; P = .22), or decrease in oxygen saturation {\textgreater} 3\% (53.9\% versus 55.6\%; P = .87). Duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay, and in-hospital mortality were similar between study groups. CONCLUSIONS Apneic oxygenation does not appear to increase lowest arterial oxygen saturation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients compared to usual care. These findings do not support routine use of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults.

The LASSO estimator typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and variable selection. In this article we treat the LASSO as a convex pro-gramming problem and derive its dual. Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new insights into the characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an improved method for estimating its covariance matrix. Using these results we also develop an efficient algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable even in cases where the number of regressors exceeds the number of observations.

	abstract = {Aim: Recently three large post product placement studies, comparing mechanical chest compression (cc) devices to those who received manual cc, found equivalent outcome results for both groups. Thus the question arises whether those results could be replicated using the devices on a daily routine. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 948 patients over a 12 months period. Chi-Square test and Mann-Whitney- U test were used to assess differences between "manual" and "mechanical" cc subgroups. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression hazard analysis were used to assess the influence of cc type on survival. Results: A mechanical cc device was used in 30.1\% (n= 283) cases. Patients who received mechanical cc had a significantly worse neurological outcome - measured in cerebral performance category (CPC) - than the manual cc group (56.8\% vs. 78.6\%, p= 0.009). Patients receiving mechanical cc were significantly younger, more were male and were more likely to have bystander CPR and an initially shock-able ECG rhythm. There was no difference in the quality of CPR that might explain the worse outcome in mechanical cc patients. Conclusion: Even with high quality CPR in both, manual and mechanical cc groups, outcome in patients who received mechanical cc was significantly worse. The anticipated benefits of a higher compression ratio and a steadier compression depth of a mechanical cc device remain uncertain. In this study selection for mechanical cc was not standardized, and was non-random. This merits further investigation. Further research on how mechanical cc is chosen and used should be considered.},

Compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation had significantly greater odds of return of spontaneous circulation (odds ratio, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.36, 1.92], p {\textless} 0.001). The treatment effect for piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation was similar to manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 1.25 [95\% CI, 0.92, 1.68];p = 0.151). The corresponding difference in percentages of return of spontaneous circulation rates from cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 8.3\% for load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 5.2\% for piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, combining both mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices produced a significant treatment effect in favor of higher odds of return of spontaneous circulation with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices (odds ratio, 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.32, 1.78], p {\textless} 0.001).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: The ability to achieve return of spontaneous circulation with mechanical chest compression devices is significantly improved when compared with manual chest compressions. In the case of load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it was superior to manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation as the odds of return of spontaneous circulation were over 1.6 times greater. The robustness of these findings should be tested in large randomized clinical trials.},

Methods: Systematic review of studies evaluating the effectiveness of mechanical chest compression. We included randomised controlled trials or cluster randomised trials that compared mechanical chest compression (using any device) with manual chest compression for adult patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Outcome measures were return of spontaneous circulation, survival of event, overall survival, survival with good neurological outcome. Results were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Data sources: Studies were identified by searches of electronic databases, reference lists of other studies and review articles. Results: Five trials were included, of which three evaluated the LUCAS or LUCAS-2 device and two evaluated the AutoPulse device. The results did not show an advantage to the use of mechanical chest compression devices for survival to discharge/30 days (average OR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.77, 1.02) and survival with good neurological outcome (average OR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.53, 1.11).

1674 hospitals in the United States.Main Outcome MeasuresPrevalence of presentation without chest pain; clinical characteristics,
treatment, and mortality among MI patients without chest pain vs those with
chest pain.ResultsOf all patients diagnosed as having MI, 142,445 (33\%) did not have chest
pain on presentation to the hospital. This group of MI patients was, on average,
7 years older than those with chest pain (74.2 vs 66.9 years), with a higher
proportion of women (49.0\% vs 38.0\%) and patients with diabetes mellitus (32.6\%
vs 25.4\%) or prior heart failure (26.4\% vs 12.3\%). Also, MI patients without
chest pain had a longer delay before hospital presentation (mean, 7.9 vs 5.3
hours), were less likely to be diagnosed as having confirmed MI at the time
of admission (22.2\% vs 50.3\%), and were less likely to receive thrombolysis

	abstract = {Objective: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines recommend the administration of chest compressions (CC) at a standardized rate and depth without guidance from patient physiologic output. The relationship between CC performance and actual CPR-generated blood flow is poorly understood, limiting the ability to define "optimal" CPR delivery. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) has been proposed as a surrogate measure of blood flow during CPR, and has been suggested as a tool to guide CPR despite a paucity of clinical data. We sought to quantify the relationship between ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and CPR characteristics during clinical resuscitation care. Methods: Multicenter cohort study of 583 in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with time-synchronized ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and CPR performance data captured between 4/2006 and 5/2013. ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, ventilation rate, CC rate and depth were averaged over 15-s epochs. A total of 29,028 epochs were processed for analysis using mixed-effects regression techniques. Results: CC depth was a significant predictor of increased ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. For every 10mm increase in depth, ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was elevated by 1.4mmHg (p{\textless}.001). For every 10 breaths/min increase in ventilation rate, ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was lowered by 3.0mmHg (p{\textless}.001). CC rate was not a predictor of ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} over the dynamic range of actual CC delivery. Case-averaged ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values in patients with return of spontaneous circulation were higher compared to those who did not have a pulse restored (34.5??4.5 vs 23.1??12.9mmHg, p{\textless}.001). Conclusions: ETCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values generated during CPR were statistically associated with CC depth and ventilation rate.

METHODS: We studied adult OHCA in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). Primary exposures were ETI, SGA, or no advanced prehospital airway placed. Primary outcomes were sustained ROSC, survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, and neurologically-intact survival to hospital discharge (cerebral performance category 1-2). Propensity scores characterized the probability of receiving ETI, SGA, or no advanced airway. We adjusted for Utstein confounders. Multivariable random effects regression accounted for clustering by EMS agency. We compared outcomes between (1) ETI vs. SGA, and (2) [no advanced airway] vs. [ETI or SGA].

RESULTS: Of 10,691 OHCA, 5591 received ETI, 3110 SGA, and 1929 had no advanced airway. Unadjusted neurologically-intact survival was: ETI 5.4\%, SGA 5.2\%, no advanced airway 18.6\%. Compared with SGA, ETI achieved higher sustained ROSC (OR 1.35; 95\%CI 1.19-1.54), survival to hospital admission (1.36; 1.19-1.55), hospital survival (1.41; 1.14-1.76) and hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome (1.44; 1.10-1.88). Compared with [ETI or SGA], patients receiving no advanced airway attained higher survival to hospital admission (1.31; 1.16-1.49), hospital survival (2.96; 2.50-3.51) and hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome (4.24; 3.46-5.20).

CONCLUSION: In CARES, survival was higher among OHCA receiving ETI than those receiving SGA, and for patients who received no advanced airway than those receiving ETI or SGA.},

The major tool is the electrocardiogram (ECG), even though the sensitivity and specificity may be variable, depending on presentation. Additional leads could be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG. Objective: To document the use of the Lewis lead in improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG in wide QRS tachycardia. Case report: A 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, in treatment with methotrexate, was admitted with progressive dyspnea that evolved to acute respiratory distress and shock at arrival. Pneumonia was diagnosed as the infection and she received antibiotics, and respiratory and inotropic support. She was also using amiodarone for more than 10 years, but she couldn't state the reason. On cardiac monitoring, wide QRS tachycardia was detected and ventricular tachycardia was considered on the differential diagnosis. The standard 12-lead ECG was complemented with the Lewis lead, obtained with higher speed and amplitude, demonstrating atrioventricular concordance and excluding ventricular tachycardia. The patient was treated for septic shock, and she died 2 days later. Conclusion: The Lewis lead is a simple and easy strategy to enhance atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research has demonstrated significant relationships between peri-shock pause and survival to discharge from out-of-hospital shockable cardiac arrest (OHCA). Objective: To determine the impact of peri-shock pause on survival from OHCA during the ROC PRIMED randomized controlled trial. Methods: We included patients in the ROC PRIMED trial who suffered OHCA between June 2007 and November 2009, presented with a shockable rhythm and had CPR process data for at least one shock. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between peri-shock pause duration and survival to hospital discharge. Results: Among 2006 patients studied, the median (IQR) shock pause duration was: pre-shock pause 15. s (8, 22); post-shock pause 6. s (4, 9); and peri-shock pause 22.0. s (14, 31). After adjusting for Utstein predictors of survival as well as CPR quality measures, the odds of survival to hospital discharge were significantly higher for patients with pre-shock pause {\textless}10. s (OR: 1.52, 95\% CI: 1.09, 2.11) and peri-shock pause {\textless}20. s (OR: 1.82, 95\% CI: 1.17, 2.85) when compared to patients with pre-shock pause ???20. s and peri-shock pause ???40. s. Post-shock pause was not significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge. Results for neurologically intact survival (Modified Rankin Score. ???. 3) were similar to our primary outcome. Conclusions: In patients with cardiac arrest presenting in a shockable rhythm during the ROC PRIMED trial, shorter pre- and peri-shock pauses were significantly associated with higher odds of survival. Future cardiopulmonary education and technology should focus on minimizing all peri-shock pauses. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

We aim to obviate the limited applicability of RCTs to real-world settings by undertaking meta-analyses of both RCTs and observational studies. METHODS AND RESULTS We included all RCTs and observational studies, without language restriction, published up to May 1, 2008. We completed separate bayesian hierarchical random-effect meta-analyses for 23 RCTs (8140 patients) and 32 observational studies (185 900 patients). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with reductions in short-term ({\textless} or =6-week) mortality of 34\% (odds ratio, 0.66; 95\% credible interval, 0.51 to 0.82) in randomized trials, and 23\% lower mortality (odds ratio, 0.77; 95\% credible interval, 0.62 to 0.95) in observational studies. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with reductions in stroke of 63\% in RCTs and 61\% in observational studies. At long-term follow-up ({\textgreater} or =1 year), primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with a 24\% reduction in mortality (odds ratio, 0.76; 95\% credible interval, 0.58 to 0.95) and a 51\% reduction in reinfarction (odds ratio, 0.49; 95\% credible interval, 0.32 to 0.66) in RCTs. However, there was no conclusive benefit of primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the long term in the observational studies. CONCLUSIONS Compared with fibrinolytic therapy, primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with short-term reductions in mortality, reinfarction, and stroke in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with long-term reductions in mortality and reinfarction in RCTs, but there was no conclusive evidence for a long-term benefit in mortality and reinfarction in observational studies.},

The first emergency department 12-lead ECG was provided by medical records at the receiving hospital, and the principal hospital diagnosis for the event was extracted from chart data. Two cardiologists, blinded to the hospital diagnosis, provided their consensus interpretation of 1,209 pairs of ECGs, noting the presence or absence of specific abnormalities on each tracing.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Among the 82 patients who had an eventual hospital diagnosis of STEMI, the study cardiologists identified 71 with ST-segment elevations on the ECGs they examined. The vast majority of these (97\%) were observed on both ECGs, but the prehospital ECG showed ST-segment elevation for two additional patients (3\%). No additional instances were seen only on the hospital ECG. Among the 116 patients with a hospital diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the cardiologists identified 36 with ST-segment depressions: 28 (78\%) of these were present on both ECGs, seven (19\%) only on the prehospital ECG, and one (3\%) only on the hospital ECG. Among the 567 patients with any cardiac hospital diagnosis, the cardiologists identified 87 with arrhythmias: 73 (84\%) on both ECGs, 12 (14\%) only on the prehospital ECG, and two (2\%) only on the hospital ECG.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Beyond identifying ST-segment elevation earlier, prehospital ECGs detect important transient abnormalities, information not otherwise available from the first emergency department ECG.

	abstract = {Background The implementation of regional primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) programs has been critical in achieving timely intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, 1 consequence has been inappropriate and false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activations where either angiography is cancelled or no culprit lesion is found, respectively. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1,391 patients referred for primary PCI to a single academic center from November 2007 to August 2013. Our purpose was to determine the incidence and characteristics of inappropriate and false-positive CCL activations by emergency departments (EDs) or emergency medical services (EMS), and the effect of a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce such events implemented during this period. Results During the study period, there were 37 (2.7\%) inappropriate and 206 (14.8\%) false-positive CCL activations. There was no difference between the ED and EMS rates of inappropriate activation (2.1\% vs 3.8\%, P =.06). Among patients who proceeded to angiography, the false-positive rate for ED CCL activation was 16.9\% compared to 11.5\% for EMS (P =.01). Although there was no difference comparing inappropriate activation or false-positive rates before and after the QI initiative (P =.22), we observed an encouraging year-to-year trend. Conclusions Emergency department activation of the CCL is associated with a higher false-positive rate than activation by EMS. Further QI efforts are required to improve communication between interventional cardiologists, emergency physicians, and paramedics to improve the specificity of CCL activation while taking care not to sacrifice sensitivity and rapidity of diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Prolonged chest compression interruptions immediately preceding and following a defibrillation shock reduce shock success and survival after cardiac arrest. We tested the hypothesis that compression pauses would be shorter using an AED equipped with a new Analysis during Compressions with Fast Reconfirmation (ADC-FR) technology, which features automated rhythm analysis and charging during compressions with brief reconfirmation analysis during compression pause, compared with standard AED mode. Methods: BLS-certified emergency medical technicians (EMTs) worked in pairs and performed two trials of simulated cardiac resuscitation with a chest compression sensing X Series defibrillator (ZOLL Medical). Each pair was randomized to perform a trial of eight 2-min compression intervals (randomly assigned to receive four shockable and four non-shockable rhythms) with the defibrillator in standard AED mode and another trial in ADC-FR mode. Subjects were advised to follow defibrillator prompts, defibrillate if "shock advised," and switch compressors every two intervals. Compression quality data were reviewed using RescueNet Code Review (ZOLL Medical) and analyzed using paired t-tests. Results: Thirty-two EMT-basic prehospital providers (59\% male; median 25 years age [IQR 22-27]) participated in the study. End of interval compression interruptions were significantly reduced with ADC-FR vs. AED mode (. p{\textless}. 0.001). For shockable rhythms, pre-shock pause was reduced significantly with ADC-FR compared with AED use (7.35. ±. 0.16. s vs. 12.0. ±. 0.22. s, p{\textless}. 0.001) whereas post-shock pause was similar (2.08. ±. 0.14. s vs. 1.77. ±. 0.14. s, p=. 0.1). Conclusion: Chest compression interruptions associated with rhythm analysis and charging are reduced with use of a novel defibrillator technology, ADC-FR, which features automated rhythm analysis and charging during compressions.},

	abstract = {A number of changes occur in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of pulmonary embolism. This article deals with the diagnostic value of the newly emerged right bundle branch block (RBBB) as a manifestation of acute right ventricular overload. A certain correlation between the extent of obstruction of the pulmonary artery and the appearance of RBBB is established through dynamic monitoring of the ECG. Fifty cases of dissectionally proven pulmonary embolism are observed, in 20 of which massive trunk obstruction had taken place, and in the remaining 30 peripheral embolism in the pulmonary artery was established. With 80\% of the trunk embolism patients (16 cases), a newly emerged RBBB was detected in their ECG, and with the remaining 20\% (4 cases), ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4 were observed as well as right axis deviation. S1Q3T3 syndrome was detected among 60\% (12 cases) of trunk embolism patients. In none of the peripheral embolism cases was RBBB in the ECG registered. Thus, its appearance on dynamic monitoring of the ECG of pulmonary embolism patients is a significant sign of the probability of massive obstruction of the main pulmonary trunk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) that causes severe pulmonary hypertension can produce specific ECG abnormalities. We hypothesized that an ECG scoring system would vary in proportion to the severity of pulmonary hypertension and would help to distinguish patients with massive PE from patients with smaller PE and those without PE. METHODS A 21-point ECG scoring system was derived (relative weights in parentheses): sinus tachycardia (2), incomplete right bundle branch block (2), complete right bundle branch block (3), T-wave inversion in leads V1 through V4 (0 to 12), S wave in lead I (0), Q wave in lead III (1), inverted T in lead III (1), and entire S1Q3T3 complex (2). ECGs obtained within 48 h prior to pulmonary arteriography were located for 60 patients (26 positive for PE, 34 negative for PE) and for 25 patients with fatal PE. RESULTS Interobserver agreement (11 readers) for ECG score was good (Spearman r = 0.74). The ECG score showed significant positive relationship to systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) in patients with PE (r = 0.387, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas no significant relationship was seen in patients without PE (r = − 0.08, p = 0.122). When patients were grouped by severity of pulmonary hypertension (low, moderate, severe), only patients with severe pulmonary hypertension from PE had a significantly higher ECG score (mean, 5.8 ± 4.9). At a cutoff of 10 points, the ECG score was 23.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 16 to 31\%) sensitive and 97.7\% (95\% CI, 96 to 99\%) specific for the recognition of severe pulmonary hypertension (sPAP {\textgreater} 50 mm Hg) secondary to PE. In 25 patients with fatal PE, the ECG score was 9.5 ± 5.2. CONCLUSIONS The derived ECG score increases with severity of pulmonary hypertension from PE, and a score≥ 10 is highly suggestive of severe pulmonary hypertension from PE.},

In event 2, participants submitted Java implementations of their algorithms to be used in the sample mobile application; we tested these in two refer-ence mobile phones using the same data set and scoring method as in event 1, obtaining 80-91\% accuracy. Event 3 was similar to event 2, but was conducted using a set of ECGs not available for study by the participants, and the scoring was a function of both accuracy and mobile phone processing speed; in this event, similar levels of accuracy were achieved with average execution times of less than 2 seconds on the reference phones.},

This work presents an algorithm for scoring the quality of measured ECG recordings is developed. Particularly, a quality score is provided that takes into account the proportional correlation observed in acceptable signals based on a diversity scheme, and their inverse relation with standard deviation. Testing of proposed algorithm is carried out upon two different databases, the first one is of own production, while the second one is obtained from Physionet.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful clinical tool for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities. Proper ECG data acquisition is essential because it allows physicians to interpret ECG results accurately and efficiently. This is especially important for patients with acute myocardial infarction, so that they can receive early treatment. As a result of multitasking, ECGs are acquired by two groups of personnel at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton - ECG technologists and non-ECG technologists. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and quality of ECG acquisition at the University of Alberta Hospital site. METHODS All adult ECGs acquired at the University of Alberta Hospital site from January 1 to June 30, 2000 were assessed. An ECG was classified as unacceptable if it lacked demographics identifying the patient, and/or it was of such poor technical quality that the interpretation was compromised. RESULTS Of 25,509 ECGs acquired during this period, 13,849 (54\%) and 11,660 (46\%) ECGs were acquired by ECG technologists and non-ECG technologists, respectively. Eleven ECGs (0.08\%) acquired by the ECG technologists and 3683 ECGs (32\%) acquired by the non-ECG technologists were of unacceptable quality. The technical cost spent on these unacceptable ECGs is approximately \$100,000 a year at this institution. CONCLUSIONS Multitasking has resulted in a high rate of unacceptable ECGs. There is a significant difference in the effectiveness and quality of ECG acquisition performed by ECG technologists and non-ECG technologists. Poorly acquired ECGs impede proper diagnosis for patients, subject the institution to potential medical legal consequences and add an unnecessary burden to the health care budget.},

Verification of good original signal level and an adequate number of ECG channels should enhance the quality. METHODS Data from all three-channel (mV5, mV1, III) recordings in Peijas hospital during one-calendar year were prospectively collected. A total of 255 recordings (24 h n = 239, and 48 h n = 16) made for 247 patients were analysed. Relative signal strength number (integer scale 5-0) was registered during hook-up. Final quality of recordings were afterwards evaluated with a three-point semi-quantitative scale by an experienced physician. RESULTS The signal strength number was adequate ({\textgreater}or=3) in all 241 available cases. Distribution of signal strength did not significantly vary between ECG channels. The overall quality of recordings was 'good' in three-fourth of the cases and only were they seldom 'poor'. Signal strength and quality ratings were not significantly interrelated. The quality was, as expected, better in 24 h recording than in 48 recordings, and it was also better in channel III than in channel mV5. CONCLUSIONS The original signal strength level (impedance) is not a crucial fact in ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings as long as it is within (specified) acceptable limits. In terms of quality, a third (inferior) ECG channel is recommendable.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine retrospectively the diagnostic accuracy of various ECG ST segment elevation criteria for the prehospital ECG diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

DESIGN AND SETTING: During a six-month period, paramedics acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs on adult chest pain patients. Investigators interpreted ECGs independently, retrospectively, and blinded to patient outcome. ECGs were classified as meeting or not meeting the six ST segment elevation criteria regardless of ECG morphology if the criteria were present in two or more anatomically contiguous leads: 1 mm or more ST segment elevation; 2 mm or more ST segment elevation; 1 mm or more ST segment elevation in the limb leads or 2 mm or more ST segment elevation in the precordial leads; and the first three criteria with the simultaneous presence of reciprocal changes. ECGs that did not meet any ST segment elevation criteria were classified as normal, nonspecific ST/T wave changes, abnormal but not ischemic, and ischemic. Hospital charts were reviewed for final cardiac diagnosis.

TYPE OF PARTICIPANT: Four hundred twenty-eight stable adult prehospital chest pain patients in whom paramedics acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs.

INTERVENTIONS: None.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 428 cases, 123 (29\%) met 1 mm or more ST segment elevation criteria. Sixty-three (51\%) of these 123 patients did not have myocardial infarctions. ECG characteristics most frequently associated with these non-myocardial infarction ECGs were left bundle branch block (21\%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (33\%). The three criteria that required the presence of reciprocal changes had the highest positive predictive values (93\% to 95\%), with sensitivities ranging from 20\% to 33\%. The criteria of 1 mm or more ST segment elevation with the simultaneous presence of reciprocal changes had a positive predictive value of 94\% and included 18 of the 21 (86\%) myocardial infarction patients who had ST segment elevation and received thrombolytic therapy within five hours after hospital arrival. Of the 428 cases, 305 (71\%) did not meet any ST segment elevation criteria and had a sensitivity of 81\% and a negative predictive value of 49\% for the absence of acute myocardial infarction.

CONCLUSION: Fifty-one percent of patients whose prehospital 12-lead ECG met 1 mm or more ST segment elevation criteria had non-myocardial infarction diagnoses. ST segment elevation alone lacks the positive predictive value necessary for reliable prehospital myocardial infarction diagnosis. Inclusion of reciprocal changes in prehospital ECG myocardial infarction criteria improved the positive predictive value to more than 90\% and included a significant majority (62\% to 86\%) of acute myocardial infarction patients with ST segment elevation who received thrombolytic therapy within five hours after hospital arrival. ST segment elevation criteria that include reciprocal changes identify patients who stand to benefit most from early interventional strategies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the emergency physician's (EP's) ability to identify the cause of ST-segment elevation (STE) in a hypothetical chest pain patient.

METHODS: Eleven electrocardiograms (ECGs) with STE were given to EPs; the patient in each instance was a 45-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with the chief complaint of chest pain. The EP was asked to determine the cause of the STE and, if due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), to decide whether thrombolytic therapy (TT) would be administered (the patient had no contraindication to such treatment). Rates of TT administration were determined; appropriate TT administration was defined as that occurring in an AMI patient, while inappropriate TT administration was defined as that in the non-AMI patient.

RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-eight EPs completed the questionnaire; levels of medical experience included the following: postgraduate year 2-3, 193 (42\%); and attending, 265 (58\%). The overall rate of correct interpretation of the study ECGs was 94.9\% (4,782 correct interpretations out of 5,038 instances). Acute myocardial infarction with typical STE, ventricular paced rhythm, and right bundle branch block were never misinterpreted. The remaining conditions were misinterpreted with rates ranging between 9\% (left bundle branch block, LBBB) and 72\% (left ventricular aneurysm, LVA). The overall rate of appropriate thrombolytic agent administration was 83\% (1,525 correct administrations out of 1,832 indicated administrations). The leading diagnosis for which thrombolytic agent was given inappropriately was LVA (28\%), followed by benign early repolarization (23\%), pericarditis (21\%), and LBBB without electrocardiographic AMI (5\%). Thrombolytic agent was appropriately given in all cases of AMI except when associated with atypical STE, where it was inappropriately withheld 67\% of the time.

CONCLUSIONS: In this survey, EPs were asked whether they would give TT based on limited information (ECG). Certain syndromes with STE were frequently misdiagnosed. Emergency physician electrocardiographic education must focus on the proper identification of these syndromes so that TT may be appropriately utilized.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: ST-segment elevation (STE) related to benign early repolarization (BER), a common normal variant, can be difficult to distinguish from acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The authors compared the electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretations of these two entities by emergency physicians (EPs) and cardiologists.

METHODS: Twenty-five cases (13 BER, 12 AMI) of patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain were identified. Criteria for BER required four of the following: 1) widespread STE (precordial greater than limb leads), 2) J-point elevation, 3) concavity of initial up-sloping portion of ST segment, 4) notching or irregular contour of J point, and 5) prominent, concordant T waves. Additional BER criteria were 1) stable ECG pattern, 2) negative cardiac injury markers, and 3) normal cardiac stress test or angiography. AMI criteria were 1) regional STE, 2) positive cardiac injury markers, and 3) identification of culprit coronary artery by angiography in less than eight hours of presentation. The 25 ECGs were distributed to 12 EPs and 12 cardiologists (four in academic medicine, four in community practice, and four in community academics [health maintenance organization] in each physician group). The physicians were informed of the patients' age, gender, and race, and they then interpreted the ECGs as BER or AMI. Undercalls (AMI misdiagnosed as BER) and overcalls (BER misdiagnosed as AMI) were calculated for each physician group.

RESULTS: Cardiologists correctly interpreted 90\% of ECGs, and EPs correctly interpreted 81\% of ECGs. The proportion of undercalls (missed AMI/total AMI) was 2.8\% for cardiologists (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09\% to 5.5\%) compared with 9.7\% for EPs (95\% CI = 4.8\% to 14.6\%) (p = 0.02). The proportion of overcalls (missed BER/total BER) was 17.3\% for cardiologists (95\% CI = 11.4\% to 23.3\%) versus 27.6\% for EPs (95\% CI = 20.6\% to 34.6\%) (p = 0.03). The mean number of years in practice was 19.8 for cardiologists (95\% CI = 19 to 20.5) and 11 years for EPs (95\% CI = 10.5 to 12.0) (p {\textless} 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Although correct interpretation was high in both groups, cardiologists, who had significantly more years of practice, had fewer misinterpretations than EPs in distinguishing BER from AMI electrocardiographically.},

	abstract = {Study Objective
We compare aromatherapy with inhaled isopropyl alcohol versus oral ondansetron for treating nausea among emergency department (ED) patients not requiring immediate intravenous access.
Methods
In a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled a convenience sample of adults presenting to an urban tertiary care ED with chief complaints including nausea or vomiting. We randomized subjects to 1 of 3 arms: inhaled isopropyl alcohol and 4 mg oral ondansetron, inhaled isopropyl alcohol and oral placebo, and inhaled saline solution placebo and 4 mg oral ondansetron. The primary outcome was mean nausea reduction measured by a 0- to 100-mm visual analog scale from enrollment to 30 minutes postintervention. Secondary outcomes included receipt of rescue antiemetic medications and adverse events.
Results
We enrolled 122 subjects, of whom 120 (98.3\%) completed the study. Of randomized subjects, 40 received inhaled isopropyl alcohol and oral ondansetron, 41 received inhaled isopropyl alcohol and oral placebo, and 41 received inhaled saline solution placebo and oral ondansetron. The mean decrease in nausea visual analog scale score in each arm was 30 mm (95\% confidence interval [CI] 22 to 37 mm), 32 mm (95\% CI 25 to 39 mm), and 9 mm (95\% CI 5 to 14 mm), respectively. The proportions of subjects who received rescue antiemetic therapy in each arm were 27.5\% (95\% CI 14.6\% to 43.9\%), 25.0\% (95\% CI 12.7\% to 41.2\%), and 45.0\% (95\% CI 29.3\% to 61.5\%), respectively. There were no adverse events.
Conclusion
Among ED patients with acute nausea and not requiring immediate intravenous access, aromatherapy with or without oral ondansetron provides greater nausea relief than oral ondansetron alone.},

Identifying demographics were used to query the electronic medical record of the responding city fire agency and contracted transporting ambulance service.

No.

The heart’s native atrial activity in patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation causes atrial sensing, which triggers the ventricular pacing at the pacemaker’s maximal preprogrammed rate.

The differential diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia with pacing spikes includes pacemaker mediated tachycardia and runaway pacemaker syndrome.

Deactivation of atrial lead.

The main purpose of a dual chamber pacemaker is to achieve atrioventricular synchrony. This is achieved by the atrial lead sensing atrial depolarisation and triggering the ventricular lead to depolarise the ventricle after some atrioventricular delay. In patients with no native atrioventricular conduction as in complete heart block, if the native atrial rate increases, the ventricular lead follows suit and discharges at the corresponding rate to maintain atrioventricular synchrony. …},

	abstract = {Introduction: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion is an increasingly common intervention for patients with advanced heart failure; however, published literature on the emergency department (ED) presentation of this population is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize ED presentations of patients with LVADs with a focus on device-specific complications to inform provider education and preparation initiatives. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of all patients with LVADs followed at an urban academic medical center presenting to the ED over a five-year period (July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2014). Two abstractors reviewed 45 randomly selected charts to standardize the abstraction process and establish a priori categories for reason for presentation to the ED. Remaining charts were then divided evenly for review by one of the two abstractors. Primary outcomes for this study were (1) frequency of and (2) reason for presentation to the ED by patients with LVADs. Results: Of 349 patients with LVADs identified, 143 (41.0\%) had ED encounters during the study period. There were 620 total ED encounters, (range 1 to 32 encounters per patient, median=3, standard deviation=5.3). Among the encounters, 431 (69.5\%) resulted in admission. The most common reasons for presentation were bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal, epistaxis) (182, 29.4\%); infection (127, 20.5\%); heart failure exacerbation (68, 11.0\%); pain (56, 9.0\%); other (45, 7.3\%); and arrhythmias (40, 6.5\%). Fifty-two encounters (8.4\%) were device-specific; these patients frequently presented with abnormal device readings (37, 6.0\%). Interventions for device-specific presentations included anticoagulation regimen adjustment (16/52, 30.8\%), pump exchange (9, 17.3\%), and hardware repair (6, 11.5\%). Pump thrombosis occurred in 23 cases (3.7\% of all encounters). No patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation or died in the ED. Conclusion: This is the largest study known to the investigators to report the rate of ED presentations of patients with LVADs and provide analysis of device-specific presentations. In patients who do have device-specific ED presentations, pump thrombosis is a common diagnosis and can present without device alarms. Specialized LVAD education and preparation initiatives for ED providers should emphasize the recognition and management of the most common and critical conditions for this patient population, which have been identified in this study as bleeding, infection, heart failure, and pump thrombosis.},

	abstract = {Background Despite regular criticisms of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), a focus on testing persists, sometimes in the belief to get published and sometimes encouraged by journal reviewers. This paper aims to demonstrate known key limitations of NHST using simple nontechnical illustrations. Design The first illustration is based on simulated data of 20 000 studies that compare two groups for an outcome event. The true effect size (difference in event rates) and sample size (20-100 per group) were varied. The second illustration used real data from a meta-analysis on alpha-blockers for the treatment of ureteric stones. Results The simulations demonstrated the large between-study variability in P-values (range between {\textless}.0001 and 1 for most simulation conditions). A focus on statistically significant effects (P {\textless} .05), notably in small to moderate samples, led to strongly overestimated effect sizes (up to 240\%) and many false-positive conclusions, that is statistically significant effects that were, in fact, true null effects. Effect sizes also exerted strong between-study variability, but confidence intervals accounted for this: the interval width decreased with larger sample size, and the percentage of intervals that contained the true effect size was accurate across simulation conditions. Reducing alpha level, as recently suggested, reduced false-positive conclusions but strongly increased the overestimation of significant effects (up to 320\%). Conclusions Researchers and journals should abandon statistical significance as a pivotal element in most scientific publications. Confidence intervals around effect sizes are more informative, but should not merely be reported to comply with journal requirements.},

	abstract = {The number of ventricular assist devices (VADs) being implanted for terminal heart failure is rising at an exponential rate. These implanted patients have a decreased mortality, but still have significant morbidities, as the prevalence of these patients increases in the community. When VAD patients are discharged to home, they will very likely require emergency medical services (EMSs) and emergency medical doctors (EDs) with their future care. The interface of these patients with the community would suggest an increasing prevalence of encounters requiring the need for acute medical care. This will place the initial responsibility of these patients in the hands of EMS first responders and emergency room providers. To date, there is very little literature published on out-of-hospital or ED care for VAD patients. Most EMS personnel and ED feel uncomfortable treating a patient with a VAD because they have not had sufficient exposure. The cardiovascular treatment of VAD patients in the field can pose different challenges typically encountered including difficulties measuring a pulse and sometimes undetectable BP. Despite these unique challenges, official guidelines or even standard operating procedures regarding the emergency treatment of VAD patients are still lacking. We present a basic overview of the most commonly used left VAD systems and propose guidelines that should be followed in the event of an emergency with a VAD patient out of hospital.},

In the near future, more and more cardiologists will encounter VAD patients in their clinical practice and need to know how to handle the inherent risks associated with VAD use. The emergency care of a VAD patient differs from that of conventional practice and specific expertise is required to avoid inappropriate management that could lead to inefficient treatment and/or dangerous consequences. Here, we describe two emergency scenarios in VAD patients, two paradigmatic clinical in-hospital situations, in different settings. Following a brief overview of the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers in VAD patients, we propose a working algorithm that might help to ensure a timely and efficient response to acute demands in this setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of left ventricular assist devices is an accepted therapy for patients with refractory heart failure, but current pulsatile volume-displacement devices have limitations (including large pump size and limited long-term mechanical durability) that have reduced widespread adoption of this technology. Continuous-flow pumps are newer types of left ventricular assist devices developed to overcome some of these limitations. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter study without a concurrent control group, 133 patients with end-stage heart failure who were on a waiting list for heart transplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow pump. The principal outcomes were the proportions of patients who, at 180 days, had undergone transplantation, had cardiac recovery, or had ongoing mechanical support while remaining eligible for transplantation. We also assessed functional status and quality of life. RESULTS: The principal outcomes occurred in 100 patients (75\%). The median duration of support was 126 days (range, 1 to 600). The survival rate during support was 75\% at 6 months and 68\% at 12 months. At 3 months, therapy was associated with significant improvement in functional status (according to the New York Heart Association class and results of a 6-minute walk test) and in quality of life (according to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires). Major adverse events included postoperative bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous lead infection. Pump thrombosis occurred in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: A continuous-flow left ventricular assist device can provide effective hemodynamic support for a period of at least 6 months in patients awaiting heart transplantation, with improved functional status and quality of life.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Contemporary ventricular assist device therapy results in a high rate of successful heart transplantation but is associated with bleeding, infections, and other complications. Further reductions in pump size, centrifugal design, and intrapericardial positioning may reduce complications and improve outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS We studied a small, intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow centrifugal pump in patients requiring an implanted ventricular assist device as a bridge to heart transplantation. The course of investigational pump recipients was compared with that of patients implanted contemporaneously with commercially available devices. The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the originally implanted device, transplantation, or explantation for ventricular recovery at 180 days and was evaluated for both noninferiority and superiority. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of survival between groups and functional and quality-of-life outcomes and adverse events in the investigational device group. A total of 140 patients received the investigational pump, and 499 patients received a commercially available pump implanted contemporaneously. Success occurred in 90.7\% of investigational pump patients and 90.1\% of controls, establishing the noninferiority of the investigational pump (P{\textless}0.001; 15\% noninferiority margin). At 6 months, median 6-minute walk distance improved by 128.5 m, and both disease-specific and global quality-of-life scores improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS A small, intrapericardially positioned, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump was noninferior to contemporaneously implanted, commercially available ventricular assist devices. Functional capacity and quality of life improved markedly, and the adverse event profile was favorable. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Interruptions and multitasking have been demonstrated in experimental studies to reduce individuals' task performance. These behaviours are frequently used by clinicians in high-workload, dynamic clinical environments, yet their effects have rarely been studied. OBJECTIVE To assess the relative contributions of interruptions and multitasking by emergency physicians to prescribing errors. METHODS 36 emergency physicians were shadowed over 120 hours. All tasks, interruptions and instances of multitasking were recorded. Physicians' working memory capacity (WMC) and preference for multitasking were assessed using the Operation Span Task (OSPAN) and Inventory of Polychronic Values. Following observation, physicians were asked about their sleep in the previous 24 hours. Prescribing errors were used as a measure of task performance. We performed multivariate analysis of prescribing error rates to determine associations with interruptions and multitasking, also considering physician seniority, age, psychometric measures, workload and sleep. RESULTS Physicians experienced 7.9 interruptions/hour. 28 clinicians were observed prescribing 239 medication orders which contained 208 prescribing errors. While prescribing, clinicians were interrupted 9.4 times/hour. Error rates increased significantly if physicians were interrupted (rate ratio (RR) 2.82; 95\% CI 1.23 to 6.49) or multitasked (RR 1.86; 95\% CI 1.35 to 2.56) while prescribing. Having below-average sleep showed a {\textgreater}15-fold increase in clinical error rate (RR 16.44; 95\% CI 4.84 to 55.81). WMC was protective against errors; for every 10-point increase on the 75-point OSPAN, a 19\% decrease in prescribing errors was observed. There was no effect of polychronicity, workload, physician gender or above-average sleep on error rates. CONCLUSION Interruptions, multitasking and poor sleep were associated with significantly increased rates of prescribing errors among emergency physicians. WMC mitigated the negative influence of these factors to an extent. These results confirm experimental findings in other fields and raise questions about the acceptability of the high rates of multitasking and interruption in clinical environments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Frequent interruptions are assumed to have a negative effect on healthcare clinicians' working memory that could result in risk for errors and hence threatening patient safety. The aim of this study was to explore interruptions occurring during common activities of clinicians working in emergency departments. METHOD Totally 18 clinicians, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses and medical doctors, at two Swedish emergency departments were observed during clinical work for 2 h each. A semistructured interview was conducted directly after the observation to explore their perceptions of interruptions. Data were analysed using non-parametric statistics, and by quantitative and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS The interruption rate was 5.1 interruptions per hour. Most often the clinicians were exposed to interruptions during activities involving information exchange. Calculated as percentages of categorised performed activities, preparation of medication was the most interrupted activity (28.6\%). Face-to-face interaction with a colleague was the most common way to be interrupted (51\%). Most common places for interruptions to occur were the nurses' and doctors' stations (68\%). Medical doctors were the profession interrupted most often and were more often recipients of interruptions induced by others than causing self-interruptions. Most (87\%) of the interrupted activities were resumed. Clinicians often did not regard interruptions negatively. Negative perceptions were more likely when the interruptions were considered unnecessary or when they disturbed the work processes. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians were exposed to interruptions most often during information exchange. Relative to its occurrence, preparation of medication was the most common activity to be interrupted, which might increase risk for errors. Interruptions seemed to be perceived as something negative when related to disturbed work processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
It is unclear how workflow interruptions impact emergency physicians at the point of care. 

OBJECTIVES
Our study aimed to evaluate interruption characteristics experienced by academic emergency physicians. 

METHODS
This prospective, observational study collected interruptions during attending physician shifts. An interruption is defined as any break in performance of a human activity that briefly requires attention. One observer captured interruptions using a validated tablet PC-based tool that time stamped and categorized the data. Data collected included: 1) type, 2) priority of interruption to original task, and 3) physical location of the interruption. A Kruskal-Wallis H test compared interruption priority and duration. A chi-squared analysis examined the priority of interruptions in and outside of the patient rooms. 

RESULTS
A total of 2355 interruptions were identified across 210 clinical hours and 28 shifts (means = 84.1 interruptions per shift, standard deviation = 14.5; means = 11.21 interruptions per hour, standard deviation = 4.45). Physicians experienced face-to-face physician interruptions most frequently (26.0\%), followed by face-to-face nurse communication (21.7\%), and environment (20.8\%). There was a statistically significant difference in interruption duration based on the interruption priority, χ2(2) = 643.98, p {\textless} 0.001, where durations increased as priority increased. Whereas medium/normal interruptions accounted for 53.6\% of the total interruptions, 53\% of the interruptions that occurred in the patient room (n = 162/308) were considered low priority (χ2 [2, n = 2355] = 78.43, p {\textless} 0.001). 

CONCLUSIONS
Our study examined interruptions over entire provider shifts and identified patient rooms as high risk for low-priority interruptions. Targeting provider-centered interventions to patient rooms may aid in mitigating the impacts of interruptions on patient safety and enhancing clinical care.},

	abstract = {Study Objective: We sought to determine the number of interruptions and to characterize tasks performed in emergency departments compared with those performed in primary care offices. Methods: We conducted an observational time-motion, task-analysis study in 5 nonteaching community hospitals and 22 primary care offices in 5 central Indiana cities. Twenty-two emergency physicians and 22 office-based primary care physicians (PCPs) were observed at work. The number of interruptions, tasks, simultaneous tasks, and patients concurrently managed were recorded in 1-minute increments during 150- to 210-minute observation periods. Results: Emergency physicians were interrupted an average of 9.7 times per hour compared with 3.9 times per hour for PCPs, for an average difference of 5.8 times per hour (95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.2 to 7.4). PCPs spent an average of 11.4 minutes per hour performing simultaneous tasks compared with 6.4 minutes per hour for emergency physicians (average difference, 5.0 minutes; 95\% CI 1.2 to 8.8). Emergency physicians spent an average of 37.5 minutes per hour managing 3 or more patients concurrently compared with 0.9 minutes per hour for PCPs. PCPs spent significantly more time performing direct patient care, and emergency physicians spent significantly more time in analyzing data, charting, and taking reports on patients. Conclusion: Emergency physicians experienced more interruptions and managed more patients concurrently than PCPs. PCPs spent more time performing simultaneous tasks than emergency physicians. Our study suggests there are important ergonomic differences between emergency medicine and office-based primary care work environments that may require different training approaches, design considerations, and coping strategies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND A significant increase in false positive ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) electrocardiogram interpretations was noted after replacement of all of the City of San Diego's 110 monitor-defibrillator units with a new brand. These concerns were brought to the manufacturer and a revised interpretive algorithm was implemented. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effects of a revised interpretation algorithm to identify STEMI when used by San Diego paramedics. METHODS Data were reviewed 6 months before and 6 months after the introduction of a revised interpretation algorithm. True-positive and false-positive interpretations were identified. Factors contributing to an incorrect interpretation were assessed and patient demographics were collected. RESULTS A total of 372 (234 preimplementation, 138 postimplementation) cases met inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in false positive STEMI (150 preimplementation, 40 postimplementation; p {\textless} 0.001) after implementation. The most common factors resulting in false positive before implementation were right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation. The new algorithm corrected for these misinterpretations with most postimplementation false positives attributed to benign early repolarization and poor data quality. Subsequent follow-up at 10 months showed maintenance of the observed reduction in false positives. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that introducing a revised 12-lead interpretive algorithm resulted in a significant reduction in the number of false positive STEMI electrocardiogram interpretations in a large urban emergency medical services system. Rigorous testing and standardization of new interpretative software is recommended before introduction into a clinical setting to prevent issues resulting from inappropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory activations.},

METHODS AND RESULTS Patients (n = 5277 from 51 hospitals; 4916 with 1 year vital status) participating in the Canadian ACS Registry who were hospitalized with an ACS and had an interpretable initial ECG were included in this study. Core-lab ECG interpretation was blinded to site interpretation and outcomes. There was moderate agreement between site and core-lab regarding the predominant ECG findings (kappa = 0.49). Patients with core-lab-defined ST-elevation and cardiac marker elevation (n = 1202) not classified as ST-elevation by the site were less likely to receive acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (90 vs. 96\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), heparin (91 vs. 95\%, P = 0.04), and reperfusion therapy (14 vs. 76\%, P {\textless} 0.0001) than patients for whom there was agreement that ST-elevation was present. After adjusting for other validated prognostic factors, site-unrecognized ST-elevation was independently associated with higher mortality (odds ratio = 2.21; 95\% CI, 1.46-3.36; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with ACS, there was only moderate agreement between core-lab and site interpretation of the initial ECG.

ECG interpretations were registered prospectively using a programmed-response data sheet. A second blinded interpretation by a staff cardiologist was assumed to be correct. Only ECG discrepancies with potential or probable clinical importance were considered as errors. The ED management of patients with ECG misinterpretations was reviewed by the investigators. The study was performed at an urban university hospital using 300 consecutive ED ECGs. The analysis found 154 errors of interpretation of which nine had probable clinical significance, and 56 had indeterminant significance. The concordance was weak at 0.69 (Kappa = 0.32, weighted Kappa = 0.30) with a significant discordance (McNemar Chi 2:P {\textless} 0.05). Error rates did not differ significantly between the diverse categories of physicians. In two cases, interpretation errors impacted patient management decisions but not patient outcomes. The most frequent errors involved repolarization abnormalities, ventricular hypertrophy and hemi-blocks. While discordance was significant, errors in ECG interpretation rarely impacted patient management. Prospective evaluation of ECG interpretation may be a useful means of gauging physician skills.

We sought to determine physicians' diagnostic agreement and accuracy when interpreting potential STEMI ECGs. METHODS AND RESULTS A cross-sectional survey was performed consisting of 36 deidentified ECGs that had previously resulted in putative STEMI diagnoses. Emergency physicians, cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists participated in the survey. For each ECG, physicians were asked, "based on the ECG above, is there a blocked coronary artery present causing a STEMI?" The reference standard for ascertaining the STEMI diagnosis was subsequent emergent coronary arteriography. Responses were analyzed with generalized estimating equations to account for nested and repeated measures. One hundred twenty-four physicians interpreted a total of 4392 ECGs. Among all physicians, interreader agreement (kappa) for ECG interpretation was 0.33, reflecting poor agreement. The sensitivity to identify "true" STEMIs was 65\% (95\% CI: 63 to 67) and the specificity was 79\% (95\% CI: 77 to 81). There was a 6\% increase in the odds of accurate ECG interpretation for every 5 years of experience since medical school graduation (OR 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.10, P = 0.01). After adjusting for experience, there was no significant difference in the odds of accurate interpretation by specialty-Emergency Medicine (reference), General Cardiology (AOR 0.97, 95\% CI: 0.79 to 1.2, P = 0.80), or Interventional Cardiology physicians (AOR 1.24, 95\% CI: 0.93 to 1.7, P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS There is significant physician disagreement in interpreting ECGs with features concerning for STEMI. Such ECGs lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity to act as a suitable "stand-alone" diagnostic test.},

In addition, the use of a data-derived 'optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis.

	abstract = {A completely automated algorithm to detect poor-quality electrocardiograms (ECGs) is described. The algorithm is based on both novel and previously published signal quality metrics, originally designed for intensive care monitoring. The algorithms have been adapted for use on short (5-10 s) single- and multi-lead ECGs. The metrics quantify spectral energy distribution, higher order moments and inter-channel and inter-algorithm agreement. Seven metrics were calculated for each channel (84 features in all) and presented to either a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network or a support vector machine (SVM) for training on a multiple-annotator labelled and adjudicated training dataset. A single-lead version of the algorithm was also developed in a similar manner. Data were drawn from the PhysioNet Challenge 2011 dataset where binary labels were available, on 1500 12-lead ECGs indicating whether the entire recording was acceptable or unacceptable for clinical interpretation. We re-annotated all the leads in both the training set (1000 labelled ECGs) and test dataset (500 12-lead ECGs where labels were not publicly available) using two independent annotators, and a third for adjudication of differences. We found that low-quality data accounted for only 16\% of the ECG leads. To balance the classes (between high and low quality), we created extra noisy data samples by adding noise from PhysioNet's noise stress test database to some of the clean 12-lead ECGs. No data were shared between training and test sets. A classification accuracy of 98\% on the training data and 97\% on the test data were achieved. Upon inspection, incorrectly classified data were found to be borderline cases which could be classified either way. If these cases were more consistently labelled, we expect our approach to achieve an accuracy closer to 100\%.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Frequent interruptions within the emergency department may lead to errors that negatively impact patient care. The immediate review of electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from triage patients is one source of interruption. Limiting triage ECGs requiring immediate attending review to those interpreted by the computer as abnormal may be one way to reduce interruption. We hypothesize that triage ECGs interpreted by the computer as "normal ECG" are unlikely to have clinical significance that would affect triage care. METHODS All triage ECGs performed at the University of North Carolina were collected between November 14, 2014, and March 3, 2015, according to a standard nursing triage protocol using GE machines running Marquette 12SL software. Triage ECGs with a computer interpretation of "normal ECG" were compared to an attending cardiologist's final interpretation. Triage ECGs for which the cardiologist's interpretation differed from the computer interpretation of normal ECG were presented to two emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the goals of the study. The physicians were asked to evaluate the ECG for clinical significance. Clinical significance was defined as any change from normal that would alter triage care. Triage ECGs were considered true negatives if either the cardiologist agreed with the normal computer interpretation or if both EPs agreed that the ECG did not show clinical significance. RESULTS A total of 855 triage ECGs were collected over 16 weeks. A total of 222 (26\%) were interpreted by the computer as normal. The negative predictive value for a triage ECGs interpreted by the computer as "normal" was calculated to be 99\% (95\% confidence interval = 97\% to 99\%). Of the ECGs with a computer interpretation of normal ECG, 13 had an interpretation by an attending cardiologist other than normal. Two attending EPs reviewed these triage ECGs. One of the 13 ECGs was found to have clinical significance that would alter triage care by one of the EPs. The stated triage intervention was "bed immediately." CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that triage ECGs identified by the computer as normal are unlikely to have clinical significance that would change triage care. Eliminating physician review of triage ECGs with a computer interpretation of normal may be a safe way to improve patient care by decreasing physician interruptions.},

	abstract = {Background Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Early administration of tranexamic acid reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women aged 16 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage after a vaginal birth or caesarean section from 193 hospitals in 21 countries. We randomly assigned women to receive either 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo in addition to usual care. If bleeding continued after 30 min, or stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a second dose of 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo could be given. Patients were assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. We originally planned to enrol 15 000 women with a composite primary endpoint of death from all-causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although tranexamic acid could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. We therefore increased the sample size from 15 000 to 20 000 women in order to estimate the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death from post-partum haemorrhage. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISRCTN76912190 (Dec 8, 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00872469; and PACTR201007000192283. Findings Between March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20 060 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (n=10 051) or placebo (n=10 009), of whom 10 036 and 9985, respectively, were included in the analysis. Death due to bleeding was significantly reduced in women given tranexamic acid (155 [1·5\%] of 10 036 patients vs 191 [1·9\%] of 9985 in the placebo group, risk ratio [RR] 0·81, 95\% CI 0·65–1·00; p=0·045), especially in women given treatment within 3 h of giving birth (89 [1·2\%] in the tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1·7\%] in the placebo group, RR 0·69, 95\% CI 0·52–0·91; p=0·008). All other causes of death did not differ significantly by group. Hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (358 [3·6\%] patients in the tranexamic acid group vs 351 [3·5\%] in the placebo group, RR 1·02, 95\% CI 0·88–1·07; p=0·84). The composite primary endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5·3\%] deaths or hysterectomies in the tranexamic acid group vs 546 [5·5\%] in the placebo group, RR 0·97, 95\% CI 0·87-1·09; p=0·65). Adverse events (including thromboembolic events) did not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid versus placebo group. Interpretation Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset.

With improved reliability and technological advances, the use of VADs to support patients is increasing. Many VAD-dependent patients ultimately require heart transplants that are only available in specialized centers, necessitating an interhospital transfer. To date there are few reports of long-distance fixed wing aeromedical transport of patients dependent on a VAD. Here we describe the successful transfer of a patient supported by a biventricular assist device (BiVAD) from Cambridge, UK, to Durham, NC, via fixed-wing jet aircraft. During this transfer, we observed hemodynamic alterations secondary to gravitational forces, which should be anticipated and may be mitigated with simple maneuvers. With high-level logistical planning and appropriate medical oversight, patients dependant on BiVADs can be safely transported by fixed wing aircraft over long distances.},

Nontransplanting institutions are able to use this technology with a predetermined agreement to transfer the patient to a partnering transplant center. We report the first two cases of interhospital air and ground transport of nonambulatory or intubated pediatric ({\textless}13 kg) patients supported by Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric VADs and Ikus stationary drivers. We present our protocol for transporting this delicate patient population. In addition, we discuss important challenges encountered on these operations regarding vehicle transfers and the management of vehicle power supply. These two cases demonstrate that the transportation of pediatric patients on Berlin Heart VADs is feasible and safe and should be considered a treatment option in certain situations.},

	abstract = {The use of telehealth paradigms for the remote management of patients suffering from chronic conditions has become more commonplace with the advancement of Internet connectivity and enterprise software systems. To facilitate clinicians in managing large numbers of telehealth patients, and in digesting the vast array of data returned from the remote monitoring environment, decision support systems in various guises are often utilized. The success of decision support systems in interpreting patient conditions from physiological data is dependent largely on the quality of these recorded data. This paper outlines an algorithm to determine the quality of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings obtained from telehealth patients. Three hundred short ECG recordings were manually annotated to identify movement artifact, QRS locations and signal quality (discrete quality levels) by a panel of three experts, who then reconciled the annotation as a group to resolve any discrepancies. After applying a published algorithm to remove gross movement artifact, the proposed method was then applied to estimate the remaining ECG signal quality, using a Parzen window supervised statistical classifier model. The three-class classifier model, using a number of time-domain features and evaluated using cross validation, gave an accuracy in classifying signal quality of 78.7\% (κ = 0.67) when using fully automated preprocessing algorithms to remove gross motion artifact and detect QRS locations. This is a similar level of accuracy to the reported human inter-scorer agreement when generating the gold standard annotation (accuracy = 70-89.3\%, κ = 0.54-0.84). These results indicate that the assessment of the quality of single-lead ECG recordings, acquired in unsupervised telehealth environments, is entirely feasible and may help to promote the acceptance and utility of future decision support systems for remotely managing chronic disease conditions.},

	abstract = {We analyze the use of unsupervised ECG acquisition in the home environment. An algorithm for automatically marking ECG recordings for sections of obvious artifact is described. The algorithm was validated against a set of 150 records randomly chosen from a database of ECGs and manually annotated to identify sections of artifact. Using this algorithm 4751 single lead-I ECG recordings from 24 home-dwelling patients were examined. The ECGs were collected using a remote home monitoring system. The participant ages (N=24) ranged from 54-92 years and were suffering either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure. Percentages of amplifier saturation, high frequency artifact, low signal power and the maximum continuous section of useable ECG are quoted. 1344 records were found to contain no artifact, while 3506 records contained 10 seconds or more of uninterrupted ECG (including the 1344 with no artifact). The results show that in the majority of cases, the capture of ECG in an unsupervised home environment is achievable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Fast and accurate quality estimation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a relevant research topic that has attracted considerable interest in the scientific community, particularly due to its impact on tele-medicine monitoring systems, where the ECG is collected by untrained technicians. In recent years, a number of studies have addressed this topic, showing poor performance in discriminating between clinically acceptable and unacceptable ECG records. METHODS This paper presents a novel, simple and accurate algorithm to estimate the quality of the 12-lead ECG by exploiting the structure of the cross-covariance matrix among different leads. Ideally, ECG signals from different leads should be highly correlated since they capture the same electrical activation process of the heart. However, in the presence of noise or artifacts the covariance among these signals will be affected. Eigenvalues of the ECG signals covariance matrix are fed into three different supervised binary classifiers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The performance of these classifiers were evaluated using PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2011 data. Our best quality classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.898 in the test set, while having a complexity well below the results of contestants who participated in the Challenge, thus making it suitable for implementation in current cellular devices.},

	abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the most immediately accessible and widely used initial diagnostic tool for guiding management in patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI). Although the development of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has improved the rule-in and rule-out and risk stratification of acute MI without ST elevation, the immediate management of the subset of acute MI with acute coronary occlusion depends on integrating clinical presentation and ECG findings. Careful interpretation of the ECG might yield subtle features suggestive of ischemia that might facilitate more rapid triage of patients with subtle acute coronary occlusion or, conversely, in identification of ST-elevation MI mimics (pseudo ST-elevation MI patterns). Our goal in this review article is to consider recent advances in the use of the ECG to diagnose coronary occlusion MIs, including the application of rules that allow MI to be diagnosed on the basis of atypical ECG manifestations. Such rules include the modified Sgarbossa criteria allowing identification of acute MI in left bundle branch block or ventricular pacing, the 3- and 4-variable formula to differentiate normal ST elevation (formerly called early repolarization) from subtle ECG signs of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, the differentiation of ST elevation of left ventricular aneurysm from that of acute anterior MI, and the use of lead aVL in the recognition of inferior MI. Improved use of the ECG is essential to improving the diagnosis and appropriate early management of acute coronary occlusion MIs, which will lead to improved outcomes for patients who present with acute coronary syndrome. L’électrocardiogramme (ECG) à 12 dérivations demeure l’un des outils de diagnostic des plus accessibles et des plus utilisés pour orienter vers une prise en charge les patients qui montrent une suspicion d’infarctus du myocarde (IM). Bien que l’élaboration de dosages de la troponine cardiaque de haute sensibilité ait amélioré l’exclusion et la confirmation du diagnostic d’infarctus aigu du myocarde (IAM) et la stratification du risque d’IAM sans sus-décalage du segment ST, la prise en charge immédiate de l’IAM associé à une occlusion aiguë d’une artère coronaire dépend de l’intégration du tableau clinique et des résultats de l’ECG. L’interprétation rigoureuse de l’ECG pourrait aboutir à des caractéristiques subtiles évocatrices d’une ischémie qui favoriseraient le triage rapide des patients ayant une subtile occlusion aiguë d’une artère coronaire ou, à l’inverse, à la détection d’une simulation d’IM avec sus-décalage du segment ST (formes de pseudo-infarctus du myocarde avec sus-décalage du segment ST). Dans le présent article, notre objectif est de tenir compte des récentes avancées dans l’utilisation de l’ECG pour diagnostiquer les IM associés à l’occlusion d’une artère coronaire, y compris l’application des règles qui permettent le diagnostic de l’IM sur la base de manifestations atypiques à l’ECG. Parmi ces règles, on note les critères de Sgarbossa modifiés qui permettent la détection de l’IAM en présence d’un bloc de branche gauche ou de stimulation ventriculaire, la formule à 3 et à 4 variables pour différencier le sus-décalage normal du segment ST (anciennement appelé la repolarisation précoce) des signes subtiles à l’ECG d’une occlusion de la branche descendante antérieure de l’artère coronaire gauche, la différenciation du sus-décalage du segment ST de l’anévrisme ventriculaire gauche de celui de l’IAM de la paroi antérieure et l’utilisation de la dérivation aVL pour détecter l’IM de la paroi inférieure. Une meilleure utilisation de l’ECG est essentielle à l’optimalisation du diagnostic et de la prise en charge précoce adéquate des IM associés à l’occlusion aiguë d’une artère coronaire, et se traduira par de meilleurs résultats cliniques chez les patients qui sont atteints d’un syndrome coronarien aigu.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION We report prospectively recorded observational data from consecutive cases in which the attending pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologist considered performing pre-hospital advanced airway management but decided to withhold such interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Anaesthesiologists from eight pre-hospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region (a mixed rural and urban region with 1.27 million inhabitants) registered data from February 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. Included were patients of all ages for whom pre-hospital advanced airway management were considered but not performed. The main objectives were to investigate (1) the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' reasons for considering performing pre-hospital advanced airway management in this group of patients (2) the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' reasons for not performing pre-hospital advanced airway management (3) the methods used to treat these patients (4) the incidence of complications related to pre-hospital advanced airway management not being performed. RESULTS We registered data from 1081 cases in which the pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists' considered performing pre-hospital advanced airway management. The anaesthesiologists decided to withhold pre-hospital advanced airway management in 32.1\% of these cases (n = 347). In 75.1\% of these cases (n = 257) pre-hospital advanced airway management were withheld because of the patient's condition and in 30.8\% (n = 107) because of patient co-morbidity. The most frequently used alternative treatment was bag-mask ventilation, used in 82.7\% of the cases (n = 287). Immediate complications related to the decision of not performing pre-hospital advanced airway management occurred in 0.6\% of the cases (n = 2). CONCLUSION We have illustrated the complexity of the critical decision-making associated with pre-hospital advanced airway management. This study is the first to identify the most common reasons why pre-hospital critical care anaesthesiologists sometimes choose to abstain from pre-hospital advanced airway management as well as the alternative treatment methods used.},

	abstract = {In this paper we document our experiences with developing speech recognition for medical transcription - a system that automatically transcribes doctor-patient conversations. Towards this goal, we built a system along two different methodological lines - a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) phoneme based model and a Listen Attend and Spell (LAS) grapheme based model. To train these models we used a corpus of anonymized conversations representing approximately 14,000 hours of speech. Because of noisy transcripts and alignments in the corpus, a significant amount of effort was invested in data cleaning issues. We describe a two-stage strategy we followed for segmenting the data. The data cleanup and development of a matched language model was essential to the success of the CTC based models. The LAS based models, however were found to be resilient to alignment and transcript noise and did not require the use of language models. CTC models were able to achieve a word error rate of 20.1\%, and the LAS models were able to achieve 18.3\%. Our analysis shows that both models perform well on important medical utterances and therefore can be practical for transcribing medical conversations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to characterize pediatric out-of-hospital airway management interventions, success rates, and complications in the United States using the 2012 National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) dataset. METHODS In 2012, NEMSIS collected data from Emergency Medical Services (EMS) encounters in 40 states. We included all patients less than 18 years of age and identified all patients who had airway interventions including endotracheal intubation (ETI), bag-valve-mask ventilation (BVM), continuous positive airway pressure/bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) and alternate airways (Combitube, King LT, Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), esophageal obturator airway, and cricothyroidotomy). Success and complication rates were analyzed and compared across pediatric age groups, by race, ethnicity, clinical condition, and geographic region. RESULTS We identified a total of 949,301 pediatric patient care events in the NEMSIS 2012 dataset. 4.5\% had airway management procedures (42,936 events). Invasive airway management or ventilation (ETI, cricothyroidotomy, alternate airway, CPAP/BiPAP, BVM and other ventilation) took place in 1.5\% of patient care events (14,107). Of those who had invasive airway management, 29.9\% were less than 1 year of age, 58.1\% were male, 42.3\% were white, and 83.6\% were in urban areas. ETI occurred in 3124 of patient care events (329 per 100,000; 95\% CI 318-341). Overall success of ETI was 81.1\% (95\% CI 79.7-82.6). Lower success was noted in patients with cardiac arrest (75.5\%, 95\% CI 72.6-78.3) and those aged 1-12 months (72.1\%, 95\% CI 68.3-75.6). CONCLUSIONS Out-of-hospital pediatric advanced airway procedures were infrequently performed. Success rates are lowest in patients aged 1-12 months.},

	abstract = {AIM
To collect data regarding prehospital paediatric tracheal intubation by emergency physicians skilled in advanced airway management. 

METHODS
A prospective 8-year observational study of a single emergency physician-staffed emergency medical service. Self-reporting by emergency physicians of all children aged 0–14 years who had prehospital tracheal intubation and were attended by either anaesthesia-trained emergency physicians (group 1) or by a mixture of anaesthesia and non-anaesthesia-trained emergency physicians (group 2). 

RESULTS
Eighty-two out of 2040 children (4.0\%) had prehospital tracheal intubation (58 in group 1). The most common diagnoses were trauma (50\%; in school children, 73.0\%), convulsions (13.4\%) and SIDS (12.2\%; in infants, 58.8\%). The overall tracheal intubation success rate was 57 out of 58 attempts (98.3\%). Compared to older children, infants had a higher number of Cormack–Lehane scores of 3 or 4, “difficult to intubate” status (both 3 out of 13; 23.1\%) and a lower first attempt success rate for tracheal intubation (p=0.04). Among all 82 children 71 (86.6\%) survived to hospital admission and 63 (76.8\%) to discharge. Of the 63 survivors, 54 (85.7\%) demonstrated a favourable or unchanged neurological outcome (PCPC 1–3). The survival and neurological outcomes of infants were inferior compared to older children (p{\textless}0.001). On average an emergency physician performed one prehospital tracheal intubation in 3 years in a child and one in 13 years in an infant. 

CONCLUSIONS
Anaesthesia-trained emergency physicians working in our system report high success rates for prehospital tracheal intubation in children. Survival and neurological outcomes were considerably better than reported in previous studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objective was to compare the type, rate, and selection of injured patients for out-of-hospital airway procedures among emergency medical services (EMS) agencies in 10 sites across North America. METHODS The authors analyzed a consecutive patient, prospective cohort registry of injured adults and children with an out-of-hospital advanced airway attempt, collected from December 1, 2005, through February 28, 2007, by 181 EMS agencies in 10 sites across the United States and Canada. Advanced airway procedures were defined as orotracheal intubation, nasotracheal intubation, supraglottic airway, or cricothyrotomy. Airway procedure rates were calculated based on age-specific population values for the 10 sites and the number of injured patients with field physiologic abnormality (systolic blood pressure of {\textless} or = 90 mm Hg, respiratory rate of {\textless}10 or {\textgreater}29 breaths/min, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of {\textless} or = 12). Descriptive measures were used to compare patients between sites. RESULTS A total 1,738 patients had at least one advanced airway attempt and were included in the analysis. There was wide variation between sites in the types of airway procedures performed, including orotracheal intubation (63\% to 99\%), supraglottic airways (0 to 27\%), nasotracheal intubation (0 to 21\%), and cricothyrotomy (0 to 2\%). Use of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) varied from 0\% to 65\%. The population-adjusted rates of field airway intervention (by site) ranged from 1.2 to 22.8 per 100,000 adults and 0.2 to 4.0 per 100,000 children. Among trauma patients with physiologic abnormality, some sites performed airway procedures in almost 50\% of patients, while other sites used these procedures in fewer than 10\%. There was also large variation in demographic characteristics, physiologic measures, mechanism of injury, mode of transport, field cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and unadjusted mortality among airway patients. CONCLUSIONS Among 10 sites across North America, there was wide variation in the types of out-of-hospital airway procedures performed, population-based rates of airway intervention, and the selection of injured patients for such procedures.},

	abstract = {Prehospital anaesthesia using rapid sequence induction (RSI) is carried out internationally and in the UK despite equivocal evidence of clinical benefit. It is a core skill of the prehospital critical care service established by the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust (GWAS) in 2008. This retrospective analysis of the service’s first 150 prehospital RSIs describes intubation success rates and complications, thereby contributing towards the ongoing debate on its role and safety.
Within the GWAS critical care team, RSI is only carried out in the presence of a qualified physician and critical care paramedic (CCP). The role of the intubating practitioner is interchangeable between physician and CCP. Data were collected retrospectively from RSI audit forms and electronic patient monitor printouts.
GWAS physician and CCP teams undertook 150 prehospital RSIs between June 2008 and August 2011. The intubation success rate was 82, 91 and 97\% for the first, second and third attempts, respectively. Successful intubation on the first attempt was achieved in 58 (85\%) and 64 (78\%) patients for physicians and CCPs, respectively. RSI complications included hypoxaemia (10.2\%), hypotension (9.7\%) and bradycardia (1.3\%).
Prehospital RSI can be carried out safely, with intubation success rates and complications comparable with RSI in the emergency department. The variation in the intubation success rates between individual practitioners highlights the importance of ongoing performance monitoring, coupled with high standards of clinical governance and training.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Pre-hospital paediatric airway management is complex. A variety of pitfalls need prompt response to establish and maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Anatomical disparity render laryngoscopy different compared to the adult. The correct choice of endotracheal tube size and depth of insertion is not trivial and often challenged due to the initially unknown age of child. METHODS Data from 425 paediatric patients ({\textless}17 years of age) with any airway manipulation treated by a Swiss Air-Ambulance crew between June 2010 and December 2013 were retrospectively analysed. Endpoints were: 1) Endotracheal intubation success rate and incidence of difficult airway management in primary missions. 2) Correlation of endotracheal tube size and depth of insertion with patient's age in all (primary and secondary) missions. RESULTS In primary missions, the first laryngoscopy-guided endotracheal intubation attempt was successful in 95.3\% of cases, with an overall success rate of 98.6\%. Difficult airway management was reported in 10 (4.7\%) patients. Endotracheal tube size was frequently chosen inadequately large (overall 50 of 343 patients: 14.6\%), especially and statistically significant in the age group below 1 year (19 of 33 patients; p {\textless} 0.001). Tubes were frequently and distinctively more deeply inserted (38.9\%) than recommended by current formulae. CONCLUSION Difficult airway management, including cannot intubate and cannot ventilate situations during pre-hospital paediatric emergency treatment was rare. In contrast, the success rate of endotracheal intubation at the first attempt was very high. High numbers of inadequate endotracheal tube size and deep placement according to patient age require further analysis. Practical algorithms need to be found to prevent potentially harmful treatment.},

	abstract = {A new computerized acute coronary syndrome (ACS) computer algorithm has been developed with the aim of improving the electrocardiographic detection of acute myocardial ischemia and infarction in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this study was to determine the added value of the new ACS algorithm in assisting ED physicians to obtain a more accurate diagnosis in patients with ACS. The new algorithm combines a rule-based decision tree, which uses well-known clinical criteria and a data-centered neural network model for more robust pattern recognition. Input parameters of the neural network model consist of morphology features of derived Frank X, Y, Z waveforms and the patient’s gender and age. The neural network model was trained with electrocardiograms obtained from documented acute myocardial infarction patients at the Mayo Clinic who were a part of a research ACS database, which includes electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 5,000 individuals at hospital admission (1st ECG in the ED). The test set portion of the study was conducted in 2 steps: 1) One emergency physician and 1 cardiologist classified 1,902 clinically correlated out-of-hospital ECGs without seeing the interpretation statement from the algorithm into 1 of the following categories: 1) acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemia, or nonischemic; 2) After 9 months, the same 2 physicians classified the same group of ECGs but with the interpretation statement of the algorithm printed on the tracing. The results demonstrated that with the assistance of the new algorithm, the emergency physician and cardiologist improved their sensitivity of interpreting acute myocardial infarction by 50\% and 26\%, respectively, without a loss of specificity. The new algorithm also improved the emergency physician’s acute ischemia interpretation sensitivity by 53\% and still maintained a reasonable specificity (91\%). The new ACS algorithm provides added value for improving acute ischemia and infarction detection in the ED.},

	abstract = {The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recently proposed criteria for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These criteria were based on STj {\textgreater}0.1 mV in limbs leads and V4–V6, or STj {\textgreater}0.2 mV in V1 to V3 with criteria being met in two contiguous leads. The criteria were neither age nor sex dependent and the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether or not improved STEMI criteria that were age and gender dependent could be developed. A training set of 789 ECGs from patients presenting with chest pain due to cardiac and other causes was available for study. Revised criteria for STEMI were developed using these data as well as ECGs from a normal adult population of 859 males and 637 females. A test set of ECGs was available in the form of 1220 ECGs recorded from a separate hospital from patients presenting with chest pain. 248 patients had an acute myocardial infarction on the basis of conventional clinical criteria while 972 did not. There was an improvement in sensitivity using the new criteria compared to the old criteria from 41.5\% to 46.7\% while specificity improved from 96.0\% to 98.5\%. Specificity in normals improved from 92.6\% to 99.8\%. The conclusion drawn is that while the ACC/ESC criteria are simple to apply, they are not particularly specific and can be improved by being supplemented by other ECG measures and optimized for age and sex.},

The ED sees more than 73,000 adult patients and treats 120 STEMIs annually. The laboratory performs 3,400 catheterizations annually. The first 100 patients with a diagnosis of STEMI and cardiac catheterization laboratory activation from the ED were analyzed. For comparison, a control group of 100 other ECGs from patients without a STEMI were randomly selected from our Medtronic database using a random-number generator. For patients with STEMI, an accurate computer interpretation was "acute MI suspected." Other interpretations were counted as misses. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated with confidence intervals (CIs). The sample size was determined a priori for a 95\% CI of ±10\%.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Zero control patients were incorrectly labeled "acute MI suspected." The specificity was 100\% (100/100; 95\% CI 0.96-1.0), whereas the sensitivity was 58\% (58/100; 95\% CI 0.48-0.67). This would have resulted in 42 missed cardiac catheterization laboratory activations, but zero inappropriate activations. The most common incorrect interpretation of STEMI ECGs by the computer was "data quality prohibits interpretation," followed by "abnormal ECG unconfirmed."{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Prehospital computer interpretation is not sensitive for STEMI identification and should not be used as a single method for prehospital activation of the cardiac catheterizing laboratory. Because of its high specificity, it may serve as an adjunct to interpretation.},

However, a systematic assessment of various computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs has not been performed. METHODS We undertook a large international study to compare the performance of nine electrocardiographic computer programs with that of eight cardiologists in interpreting ECGs in 1220 clinically validated cases of various cardiac disorders. ECGs from the following groups were included in the sample: control patients (n = 382); patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 183), right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 55), or biventricular hypertrophy (n = 53); patients with anterior myocardial infarction (n = 170), inferior myocardial infarction (n = 273), or combined myocardial infarction (n = 73); and patients with combined infarction and hypertrophy (n = 31). The interpretations of the computer programs and the cardiologists were compared with the clinical diagnoses made independently of the ECGs, and the computer interpretations were compared with those of the cardiologists. RESULTS The percentage of ECGs correctly classified by the computer programs (median, 91.3 percent) was lower than that of the cardiologists (median, 96.0 percent; P less than 0.01). The median sensitivity of the computer programs was also significantly lower than that of the cardiologists in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (56.6 percent vs. 63.9 percent, P less than 0.02), right ventricular hypertrophy (31.8 percent vs. 46.6 percent, P less than 0.01), anterior myocardial infarction (77.1 percent vs. 84.9 percent, P less than 0.001), and inferior myocardial infarction (58.8 percent vs. 71.7 percent, P less than 0.0001). The median total accuracy level (the percentage of correct classifications) was 6.6 percent lower for the computer programs (69.7 percent) than for the cardiologists (76.3 percent; P less than 0.001). However, the performance of the best programs nearly matched that of the most accurate cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that some but not all computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs perform almost as well as cardiologists in identifying seven major cardiac disorders.},

	abstract = {Background:
In 2005, Orange County California Emergency Medical Services (EMS) initiated a field 12-lead program to minimize time to emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for field-identified acute myocardial infarction (MI). As the program matured, “false-positive” (defined as no PCI or coronary artery occlusion upon PCI) field MI activations have been identified as a problem for the program.

Objectives:
To identify potentially correctable factors associated with false-positive EMS triage to PCI centers.

Methods:
This was a retrospective, outcome study of EMS 12-lead cases from February 2006 to June 2007. The study system exclusively used cardiac monitor internal interpretation algorithms indicating an acute myocardial infarction as the basis for triage. Indicators and variables were defined prior to the study. Data, including outcome, was from the Orange County EMS database, which included copies of 12-lead ECGs used for field triage. Negative odds ratios (OR) of less than 1.0 for positive PCI were the statistical measure of interest.

Results:
Five hundred forty-eight patients were triaged from the field for PCI. We excluded 19 cases from the study because of death prior to PCI, refusal of PCI, and co-morbid illness (sepsis, altered consciousness) that precluded PCI. Three hundred ninety-three (74.3\%) patients had PCI with significant coronary lesions found. False-positive field triages were associated with underlying cardiac rhythm of sinus tachycardia [OR = 0.38 (95\% CI 0.23, 0.62)]; atrial fibrillation [OR = 0.43 (95\% CI = 0.20, 0.94)]; an ECG lead not recorded [OR = 0.39 (95\% CI = 0.20, 0.76)]; poor ECG baseline [OR = 0.59 (95\% CI = 0.25, 1.37)]; One of three brands of monitors used in the field [OR = 0.35 (95\% CI = 0.21, 0.59)]; and female gender [OR = 0.50 (95\% CI = 0.34, 0.75)]. Age was not associated with false-positive triage as determined by ordinal regression (p=1.00).

Conclusion:
For the urban-suburban EMS field 12-lead program studied, age was not associated with false-positive triage. It was unexpected that female gender was associated with false-positive triage. False-positive triage from the field was associated with poor ECG acquisition, underlying rhythms of atrial fibrillation and sinus tachycardia, and one brand of 12-lead monitor.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTIntroduction:Computerized interpretation of the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly being used in the basic life support (BLS) ambulance setting to reduce delays to treatment for patients suspected of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Objectives:To estimate 1) predictive values of computerized prehospital 12-lead ECG interpretation for STEMI and 2) additional on-scene time for 12-lead ECG acquisition.Methods:Over a 2-year period, 1,247 ECGs acquired by primary care paramedics for suspected STEMI were collected. ECGs were interpreted in real time by the GE-Marquette 12SL ECG analysis program. Predictive values were estimated with a bayesian latent class model incorporating the computerized ECG interpretations, consensus ECG interpretations by study cardiologists, and hospital diagnosis. On-scene time was compared for ambulance-transported patients with (n = 985) and without (n = 5,056) prehospital ECGs who received prehospital aspirin and/or nitroglycerin.Results:The computer's positive and negative predictive values for STEMI were 74.0\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] 69.6-75.6) and 98.1\% (95\% CrI 97.8-98.4), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 69.2\% (95\% CrI 59.0-78.5) and 98.9\% (95\% CrI 98.1-99.4), respectively. Prehospital ECGs were associated with a mean increase in on-scene time of 5.9 minutes (95\% confidence interval 5.5-6.3).Conclusions:The predictive values of the computerized prehospital ECG interpretation appear to be adequate for diversion programs that direct patients with a positive result to hospitals with angioplasty facilities. The estimated 26.0\% chance that a positive interpretation is false is likely too high for activation of a catheterization laboratory from the field. Acquiring prehospital ECGs does not substantially increase on-scene time in the BLS setting.},

	abstract = {Background: There is accumulating evidence that thrombolytic therapy is underused among eligible patients with acute myocardial infarction. We sought to determine whether potential errors in electrocardiographic diagnosis might be a contributing factor. Methods: Seventy-five electrocardiograms were interpreted on 2 separate occasions by 3 cardiologists. Two criteria were compared for thrombolysis eligibility: (1) measurement of ≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in 2 contiguous leads (measured) and (2) criterion 1 plus the subjective opinion that the changes represented acute transmural injury (interpretive). The results were compared with computerized interpretations by the Marquette 12SL system. Results: Raw agreement and agreement corrected for chance between raters for both criteria were excellent and tended to be better for interpretive compared with measured criteria (κ = 0.89 vs 0.78, respectively). Strict reliance on measured electrocardiographic criteria alone would have resulted in overuse of thrombolysis among all 3 raters. Based on the consensus opinion, the absolute overuse of thrombolysis would hove been approximately 15\% (P {\textless} .0034). The computer algorithm had a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity of 61.5\%. Reliance on the computerized interpretation alone would have lead to underuse of thrombolytic therapy compared with consensus opinion (21.3\% vs 34.6\%; P {\textless} .005). Conclusion: Agreement for suspected acute myocardial infarction tended to be better when the appearance of the ST segments was added to measurable ST elevation criteria. Strict reliance on measurable criteria may lead to the inappropriate overuse of thrombolysis. Although the Marquette 12SL system has excellent specificity, it has poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of thrombolysis-eligible AMI. Reliance on computerized electrocardiographic interpretation would lead to the inappropriate underuse of thrombolytic therapy in situations in which qualifying electrocardiographic criteria are actually met.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess the effectiveness of 2 automated electrocardiogram interpretation programs in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome transported to hospital by ambulance in 1 rural region of Denmark with hospital discharge diagnosis used as the gold standard and to assess the effectiveness of cardiologists' triage decisions for these patients based on initial electrocardiogram. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded in ambulances using a LIFEPAK 12 monitor/defibrillator (Physio-Control, Inc., Redmond, Washington) and transmitted digitally to an attending cardiologist. If a diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction was made, a patient was taken to a regional interventional center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention or to a local hospital. One thousand consecutive digital electrocardiograms and corresponding interpretations from LIFEPAK 12 were available, and these were subsequently interpreted by the University of Glasgow program. Electrocardiogram interpretations and cardiologists' decisions were compared to hospital discharge diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for a report of ST elevation myocardial infarction with respect to discharge diagnosis were 78\%, 91\%, and 81\% for LIFEPAK 12 and 78\%, 94\%, and 87\% for the Glasgow program. Corresponding data for attending cardiologists were 85\%, 90\%, and 81\%. In conclusion, the Glasgow program had significantly higher specificity than the LIFEPAK 12 program (p = 0.02) and the cardiologists (p = 0.004). Triage decisions were effective, with good agreement between cardiologists' decisions and discharge diagnoses. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) identification by emergency medicine services (EMS) leading to pre-hospital catheterization laboratory (CL) activation shortens ischemic time and improves outcomes. We examined the incremental value of addition of a screening clinical tool (CT), containing clinical information and a Zoll electrocardiogram (ECG)-resident STEMI identification program (ZI) to ZI alone.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: All EMS-performed and ZI-analyzed ECGs transmitted to a percutaneous coronary intervention hospital from October 2009 to January 2011 were reviewed for diagnostic accuracy. ZI performance was also compared to ECG interpretations by 2 experienced readers The CT was then retrospectively applied to determine the incremental benefit above the ZI alone.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: ST-elevation myocardial infarction was confirmed in 23 (7.5\%) of 305 patients. ZI was positive in 37 (12.1\%): sensitivity: 95.6\% and specificity: 94.6\%, positive predictive value (PPV), 59.5\%, negative predictive value (NPV), 99.6\%, and accuracy of 93.8\%. Moderate agreement was observed among the readers and ZI. CT criteria for CL activation were met in 24 (7.8\%): 20 (83.3\%) were confirmed STEMIs: sensitivity: 86.9\%, specificity: 98.5\%, a PPV: 83.3\%, and NPV: 98.6\%, accuracy of 97.7\%. CT + ZI increased PPV (P{\textless}0.05) and specificity (P{\textless}0.003) by reducing false positive STEMI identifications from 15 (4.9\%) to 4 (1.3\%).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: In an urban cohort of all EMS transmitted ECGs, ZI has high sensitivity and specificity for STEMI identification. Whereas the PPV was low, reflecting both low STEMI prevalence and presence of STEMI-mimics, the NPV was very high. These findings suggest that a simplified CT combined with computer STEMI interpretation can identify patients for pre-hospital CL activation. Confirmation of these results could improve the design of STEMI care systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes.

METHODS
In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days — a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥200\% of baseline) — all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

RESULTS
Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3\%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4\%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3\% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1\% in the saline group (P = 0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively (P = 0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4\% and 6.6\%, respectively (P = 0.60).

CONCLUSIONS
Among critically ill adults, the use of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration resulted in a lower rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction than the use of saline.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid clinical assessment and accurate ECG interpretation are requisites to ensure expeditious initiation of reperfusion therapy in patients (pts) with presumed ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Efforts to facilitate triage include reliance on computer algorithm ECG analyses, especially in rural U.S. communities and low-volume Emergency Departments.Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we analyzed the “activating” ECG (AECG) of 4,123 consecutive pts with presumed STEMI, managed within a regional STEMI reperfusion program in rural Central and Southern IL between 1/2005-12/2014. AECG’s were categorized based on the computer interpretation as “ischemic” (Isch-ECG) in the presence of the following phrases: “acute MI/injury”, “ST elevation” and “acute ischemia”. STEMI-confirmed adjudication (STEMI-C) was defined as: a.)AECG with ST elevation/LBBB , plus b.) totally occluded infarct artery or {\textgreater}60\% stenosis with filling defect on coronary angiogram, plus c.) elevated biomarker. Absence of criteria defined False activation (FA) pts.Results: Computer analyzable AECG’s were available in 3,584 (87\%) pts ; 2,685 (75\%) adjudicated as STEMI-C and 899 (25\%) as FA. An Isch-ECG was noted in 481 (54\%) and 2,351 (88\%) of FA and STEMI-C pts respectively (p{\textless}0.01). Co-morbidities were more frequently observed among the non-Isch-ECG pts, while more expeditious STEMI care was provided to the Isch-ECG group. Fibrinolytic was administered to 2.4\% of FA pts. Sensitivity and specificity of ECG computer analysis for STEMI confirmation was 87.5\% (95\% CI: 86\%-89\%) and 46.5\% (95\% CI: 43\%-50\%), respectively.Download figureDownload PowerPointConclusions: In this rural, STEMI care program, an AECG with computer interpretation of “ischemia” was associated with shorter DTB and ED dwell times, but high FA rate; observed in 54\% of all FA pts. Potential benefits and risks of STEMI treatment and triage based on ECG computer analysis must be carefully weighted within each STEMI system.},

Orthostatic hypotension was most prevalent before breakfast, especially 1 minute after standing (21.3\%), and least prevalent after lunch after 3 minutes of standing (4.9\%) (\textit{P}=.001). A regression approach to repeated measures analysis (method of general estimating equations) showed the following to be significantly associated with OH (\textit{P}≤.05): elevated supine systolic BP before breakfast, dizziness/lightheadedness on standing, male sex, medication for Parkinson disease, time of day (particularly before breakfast), greater independence in activities of daily living, and low body mass index.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}—Orthostatic hypotension occurs in more than half of frail, elderly nursing home residents, but is highly variable over time.

The aim of this study was to describe the technical structure of the 9-1-1 call-taking system and to describe its vulnerabilities that could lead to compromised patient care.
9-1-1 calls answered from mobile phones and landlines use a variety of technologies to provide information about caller location and other information. These interconnected technologies create potential cyber vulnerabilities. A variety of attacks could be carried out on 9-1-1 infrastructure to various ends. Attackers could target individuals, groups, or entire municipalities. These attacks could result in anything from a nuisance to increased loss of life in a physical attack to worse overall outcomes owing to delays in care for time-sensitive conditions. Evolving 9-1-1 systems are increasingly connected and dependent on network technology. As implications of cybersecurity vulnerabilities loom large, future research should examine methods of hardening the 9-1-1 system against attack. [J Med Internet Res 2019;21(7):e14383]},

	abstract = {Importance: Recognizing patients in whom endotracheal intubation is likely to be difficult can help alert physicians to the need for assistance from a clinician with airway training and having advanced airway management equipment available.
Objective: To identify risk factors and physical findings that predict difficult intubation.
Data Sources: The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1946 to June 2018 and from 1947 to June 2018, respectively, and the reference lists from the retrieved articles and previous reviews were searched for additional studies.
Study Selection: Sixty-two studies with high (level 1-3) methodological quality that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying difficult intubation were reviewed.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two authors independently abstracted data. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary positive likelihood ratios across studies or univariate random-effects models when bivariate models failed to converge.
Results: Among the 62 high-quality studies involving 33 559 patients, 10\% (95\% CI, 8.2\%-12\%) of patients were difficult to intubate. The physical examination findings that best predicted a difficult intubation included a grade of class 3 on the upper lip bite test (lower incisors cannot extend to reach the upper lip; positive likelihood ratio, 14 [95\% CI, 8.9-22]; specificity, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.93-0.97]), shorter hyomental distance (range of {\textless}3-5.5 cm; positive likelihood ratio, 6.4 [95\% CI, 4.1-10]; specificity, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.94-0.98]), retrognathia (mandible measuring {\textless}9 cm from the angle of the jaw to the tip of the chin or subjectively short; positive likelihood ratio, 6.0 [95\% CI, 3.1-11]; specificity, 0.98 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.0]), and a combination of physical findings based on the Wilson score (positive likelihood ratio, 9.1 [95\% CI, 5.1-16]; specificity, 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.90-0.98]). The widely used modified Mallampati score (≥3) had a positive likelihood ratio of 4.1 (95\% CI, 3.0-5.6; specificity, 0.87 [95\% CI, 0.81-0.91]).
Conclusions and Relevance: Although several simple clinical findings are useful for predicting a higher likelihood of difficult endotracheal intubation, no clinical finding reliably excludes a difficult intubation. An abnormal upper lip bite test, which is easily assessed by clinicians, raises the probability of difficult intubation from 10\% to greater than 60\% for the average-risk patient.},

	doi = {10.1136/heartjnl-2019-315034},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate emergency medical services (EMS) delays and their impact on time to treatment and mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
METHOD: We collected data on EMS time intervals from published studies across five electronic databases. The primary EMS interval was the time in minutes between first medical contact and arrival at hospital door (FMC-to-door time). Secondary intervals were other components of EMS delay. Weighted means were measured using random-effects models. Meta-regression was used to identify factors associated with EMS delays and to assess the impact of EMS delay on the proportion of patients treated within90 min and mortality.
RESULTS: Two independent reviewers included 100 studies (125 343 patients) conducted in 20 countries. The weighted mean FMC-to-door time was 41 min (n=101 646; 95\% CI 39 to 43, range 21-88). However, substantial heterogeneity was observed with each interval, which could be explained by region and urban classification, distance to hospital and method of ECG interpretation. In a meta-regression adjusted for door-to-balloon time, a 10 min increase in FMC-to-door time was associated with a 10.6\% (95\% CI 7.6\% to 13.5\%; p{\textless}0.001) reduction in the proportion of patients treated within 90 min. Shorter EMS delay was significantly associated with lower short-term mortality in patients receiving prehospital thrombolysis (p=0.018).
CONCLUSION: EMS delays account for half of the total system delay in STEMI. There is a fourfold global variation in EMS delays, which are not completely explained by differences in system characteristics. Reducing unexplained variation could yield improvements in the time to treatment and outcome of STEMI patients.

	abstract = {Study objective: Medical chart reviews are often used in emergency medicine research. However, the reliability of data abstracted by chart reviews is seldom examined critically. The objective of this investigation was to determine the proportion of emergency medicine research articles that use data from chart reviews and the proportions that report methods of case selection, abstractor training, monitoring and blinding, and interrater agreement. Methods: Research articles published in three emergency medicine journals from January 1989 through December 1993 were identified. The articles that used chart reviews were analyzed. Results: Of 986 original research articles that were identified, 244 (25\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 22\% to 28\%) relied on chart reviews. Inclusion criteria were described in 98\% (95\% CI, 96\% to 99\%), and 73\% (95\% CI, 67\% to 79\%) defined the variables being analyzed. Other methods were seldom mentioned: abstractor training, 18\% (95\% CI, 13\% to 23\%); standardized abstraction forms, 11\% (95\% CI, 7\% to 15\%); periodic abstractor monitoring, 4\% (95\% CI, 2\% to 7\%); and abstractor blinding to study hypotheses, 3\% (95\% CI, 1\% to 6\%). Interrater reliability was mentioned in 5\% (95\% CI, 3\% to 9\%) and tested statistically in .4\% (95\% CI, 0\% to 2\%). A 15\% random sample of articles was reassessed by a second investigator; interrater agreement was high for all eight criteria. Conclusion: Chart review is a common method of data collection in emergency medicine research. Yet, information about the quality of the data is usually lacking. Chart reviews should be held to higher methodologic standards, or the conclusions of these studies may be in error.

	abstract = {Telecommunications Relay Service is a telephone service that allows persons with hearing or speech disabilities to place and receive telephone calls. TRS is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for local and/or long distance calls. TRS providers – generally telephone companies – are compensated for the costs of providing TRS from either a state or a federal fund. There is no cost to the TRS user. How does TRS work? TRS uses operators, called communications assistants (CAs), to facilitate telephone calls between people with hearing and speech disabilities and other individuals. A TRS call may be initiated by either a person with a hearing or speech disability, or a person without such disability. When a person with a hearing or speech disability initiates a TRS call, the person uses a teletypewriter (TTY) or other text input device to call the TRS relay center, and gives a CA the number of the party that he or she wants to call. The CA places an outbound traditional voice call to that person, then serves as a link for the call, relaying the text of the calling party in voice to the called party, and converting to text what the called party voices back to the calling party. What forms of TRS are available? There are several forms of TRS, depending on the particular needs of the user and the equipment available:},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The American Heart Association (AHA) suggests emergency medical service (EMS) providers transporting ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center require advanced life support (ALS) skills.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential safety and time savings effectiveness of defibrillation-only emergency medical technician/primary care paramedic (EMT-D/PCP) EMS transport to a PCI center in a system where only emergency medical technician-paramedics/advanced care paramedics (EMT-Ps/ACPs) are authorized to bypass non-PCI hospitals.
METHODS: We reviewed 89 consecutive patients meeting STEMI criteria transported by EMT-Ds/PCPs per protocol by one of three paths: 1) closest non-PCI center emergency department (ED) with secondary transfer by EMT-Ps/ACPs to a PCI lab, 2) rendezvous with EMT-Ps/ACPs and diversion to a PCI lab, and 3) PCI center ED if it was closest. Actual transport times to the PCI center ED were compared to predicted transport times determined by mapping software had EMT-Ds/PCPs followed a direct path. Lastly, we recorded predefined clinically important events and advanced care interventions.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven, 51, and 11 patients followed paths 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Median transport times for path 1 were 6 (IQR 5) minutes to reach the nearest non-PCI center ED and 66 (IQR 45) minutes to the PCI center ED compared to a median predicted 13 (IQR 7) minutes to a PCI center ED had EMT-Ds/PCPs followed a direct path. Median transport time for path 2 was 12 (IQR 8) minutes compared to a median predicted time of 11 (IQR 6) minutes had no EMT-P/ACP rendezvous occurred. Median transport time for path 3 was 7 minutes (IQR 5). Three patients experienced prehospital cardiac arrest; 1 required dopamine, and 4 others received a saline bolus for hypotension.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial time savings may occur if EMT-Ds/PCPs bypass non-PCI center EDs with only a small predicted increase (about 7 minutes) in the transport time to the PCI center ED. EMT-P/ACP rendezvous does not appear to substantially increase transport time. Given the relatively low occurrence of clinically important events, our findings suggest that EMT-D/PCP bypass to a PCI center ED may be safe and effective for selected STEMI patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Difficult-airway prediction tools help identify optimal airway techniques, but were derived in elective surgery patients and may not be applicable to emergency rapid sequence intubation (RSI). The HEAVEN criteria (Hypoxemia, Extremes of size, Anatomic abnormalities, Vomit/blood/fluid, Exsanguination, Neck mobility issues) may be more relevant to emergency RSI patients.
OBJECTIVE: To validate the HEAVEN criteria for difficult-airway prediction in emergency RSI using a large air medical cohort.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis using a large air medical airway registry using data from 160 bases over a 1-year period. Standard test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value [NPV]) for the HEAVEN criteria were calculated for overall intubation success, first-attempt success, and first-attempt success without desaturation. In addition, multivariable logistic regression was used to quantify the independent association between each of the HEAVEN criteria, as well as the total number of criteria present and intubation success after adjusting for age, gender, and clinical category (burn, medical, trauma, nontraumatic shock).
RESULTS: A total of 2419 patients undergoing air medical RSI were included. Excellent NPV was observed (97\% for each of the HEAVEN criteria except "Exsanguination," which had an NPV of 87\% but specificity of 99\%). First-attempt success was lower for each of the HEAVEN criteria, with an inverse relationship observed between total HEAVEN criteria and intubation success (first-attempt success with no criteria = 94\% and with 5 + criteria = 43\%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed independent associations between each of the HEAVEN criteria, as well as total number of criteria and intubation success.
CONCLUSIONS: The HEAVEN criteria seem to be a useful tool to predict difficult airways in emergency RSI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prehospital triage of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces treatment times. Prehospital triage and transport of STEMI patients have traditionally been undertaken in emergency medical service systems with Advanced Care Paramedics (ACPs). However, ACPs are not available in many regions. A pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of prehospital STEMI triage in a region with only Primary Care Paramedics.
METHODS: Hemodynamically stable patients with chest pain and suspected STEMI were brought directly to a catheterization laboratory for primary PCI. End points included accuracy of prehospital STEMI identification, complications during transfer, and treatment times.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients with suspected STEMI were triaged for primary PCI. Only 1 patient developed complications during transport (rapid atrial flutter) that required ACP skills. One hundred thirty-three patients underwent urgent angiography, and 105 patients underwent PCI. Based on physician interpretation of the prehospital electrocardiogram, there was agreement with triage decision for 121 (90\%) of the 134 cases. The final diagnosis based on the angiogram and cardiac markers was true STEMI for 106 patients and false positive for 28 patients. The median first medical contact to balloon time was 91 (81-115) minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamically stable patients with suspected STEMI can be safely and effectively transported directly for primary PCI by paramedics without advanced care training. Prehospital STEMI triage for primary PCI can be extended to regions that have few or no paramedics with advanced care training.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Airway device placement and maintenance are of utmost importance when managing critically ill patients. The best method to secure airway devices is currently unknown. Study Objective: We sought to determine the force required to dislodge 4 types of airways with and without airway securing devices. Methods: We performed a prospective study using 4 commonly used airway devices (endotracheal tube [ETT], laryngeal mask airway [LMA], King laryngeal tube [King], and iGel) performed on 5 different mannequin models. All devices were removed twice per mannequin in random order, once unsecured and once secured as per manufacturers’ recommendations; Thomas Tube Holder (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) for ETT, LMA, and King; custom tube holder for iGel. A digital force measuring device was attached to the exposed end of the airway device and gradually pulled vertically and perpendicular to the mannequin until the tube had been dislodged, defined as at least 4 cm of movement. Dislodgement force was reported as the maximum force recorded during dislodgement. We compared the relative difference in the secured and unsecured force for each device and between devices using a random-effects regression model accounting for variability in the manikins. Results: The median dislodgment forces (interquartile range [IQR]) in pounds for each secured device were: ETT 13.3 (11.6, 14.1), LMA 16.6 (13.9, 18.3), King 21.7 (16.9, 25.1), and iGel 8 (6.8, 8.3). The median dislodgement forces for each unsecured device were: ETT 4.5 (4.3, 5), LMA 8.4 (6.8, 10.7), King 10.6 (8.2, 11.5), and iGel 3.9 (3.2, 4.2). The relative difference in dislodgement forces (95\% confidence intervals) were higher for each device when secured: ETT 8.6 (6.2 to 11), LMA 8.8 (4.6 to 13), King 12.1 (7.2 to 16.6), iGel 4 (1.1 to 6.9). When compared to secured ETT, the King required greater dislodgement force (relative difference 8.6 [4.5–12.7]). The secured iGel required less force than the secured ETT (relative difference −4.8 [−8.9 to −0.8]). Conclusion: Compared with a secured device, an unsecured airway device requires only half the force to cause airway dislodgement. The secured King had the highest dislodgement force relative to the other studied devices.},

	abstract = {The concept of a universal emergency number originated in Europe and in 1967 subsequently received federal government impetus for adoption in the United States. In 1968 the American Telephone and Telegraph Company agreed to clear the number 911 for any public safety agency and community groups that desired to develop a common public number for entry to local emergency services. Approximately 800 911 systems have been developed in the United States since 1968. In a large urban area a citizen requiring emergency assistance from area public safety agencies can be faced with choosing from over 200 emergency numbers. The choice depends variously on the location and time of day or week of the emergency. The 911 system concept was developed to transfer the agency selection process to the public safety agencies: taking it from a public generally lacking knowledge of emergency operations and telephone numbers. This paper discusses problems of public access and their resolution by 911 systems. Basic and advanced 911 systems are described. The finance, technology, operations, and management of the implementation of 911 are detailed. The description points out the necessary interactions between public support, various levels of government, and the telephone company. The difficulties encountered while resolving intra/interagency and jurisdiction disputes are stressed. Conclusions regarding the future of 911 are presented and center around the need for public support to smooth the way for cooperation among all public and private entities involved in 911.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess the hydration status of women presenting to an ED with hyperemesis gravidarum and to determine whether clinically relevant changes in orthostatic vital signs occur. Methods: A convenience sample of 23 pregnant women who had hyperemesis gravidarum, with each patient serving as her own control. The study took place in the ED observation unit of an urban teaching hospital. Women who had pregnancies of ≤16 weeks' gestation who had been vomiting for at least 24 hours were included. Supine and standing pulse rates and blood pressures (BPs) were measured sequentially after 5 minutes in each position. Patient weight and urine specific gravity (SG) also were recorded. After 6 L of lactated Ringer's solution was infused over a 12-hour period, the same measurements were repeated. Pre- and posthydration changes were analyzed using the paired t-test. Results: The mean treatment weight gain as a percentage of the total body weight was 5.6\% ± 2.2\% (mean ± SD). The urine SG decreased from 1.027 ± 0.004 to 1.008 ± 0.003 (p {\textless} 0.001). The mean change in systolic BP upon assuming the standing position was -8.3 ± 12.7 mm Hg before hydration vs 2.9 ± 7.8 mm Hg after hydration (p {\textless} 0.001). The corresponding change in mean diastolic BP was 3.7 ± 10.9 mm Hg before hydration vs 8.6 ± 10.9 mm Hg after hydration (p = 0.12). The mean change in pulse rate upon standing was 26.8 ± 14.5 beats/min before hydration vs 14.5 ± 10.1 beats/min after hydration (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Women who present to the ED with hyperemesis gravidarum are significantly dehydrated and experience measurable improvement in postural pulse rate and systolic BP changes with rehydration. However, the presenting orthostatic changes lack sufficient sensitivity to be effectively used as quantitative screening tests for dehydration.},

	abstract = {Objectives: We hypothesized that transient hypotension associated with the symptom of lightheadedness with standing is a common phenomenon in healthy adolescents but may be mistaken for orthostatic intolerance. Study design: We studied 23 healthy adolescents, combining upright tilt to 70° and to 35° (in 12 patients) with continuous heart rate and blood pressure (BP) measurements. We measured peripheral blood flow and venous pressure in the arms and legs by using venous plethysmography. Results: Healthy subjects with normal vasoconstrictive responses to sustained upright tilt uniformly have a transient fall in BP during 70° upright tilt that varies from almost undetectable to large decreases in BP easily exceeding the 20-mm Hg threshold for orthostatic hypotension. Large decreases are associated with short-lived symptoms of lightheadedness and are most marked in those with the largest calf blood flow. The higher the flow, the lower the BP falls. There is appropriate reflex tachycardia. Conclusions: We conclude that transient orthostatic hypotension is common in many healthy adolescents, especially after prolonged recumbency, and is related to dependent vascular tone.

Reference ranges for orthostatic heart rate change in this population at 2 minutes were –2 to +41 beats per minute and at 5 minutes were –1 to +48 beats per minute. Orthostatic blood pressure changes were within the adult range for 98\% of adolescents tested. One-third of participants experienced orthostatic symptoms during testing.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.
Objective
The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.
Methods
Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.
Results
This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.
Conclusions
OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.},

	abstract = {Importance: The optimal approach to airway management during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is unknown.
Objective: To determine whether a supraglottic airway device (SGA) is superior to tracheal intubation (TI) as the initial advanced airway management strategy in adults with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial of paramedics from 4 ambulance services in England responding to emergencies for approximately 21 million people. Patients aged 18 years or older who had a nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were treated by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent between June 2015 and August 2017; follow-up ended in February 2018.
Interventions: Paramedics were randomized 1:1 to use TI (764 paramedics) or SGA (759 paramedics) as their initial advanced airway management strategy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge or 30 days after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever occurred sooner. Modified Rankin Scale score was divided into 2 ranges: 0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 (poor outcome; 6 = death). Secondary outcomes included ventilation success, regurgitation, and aspiration.
Results: A total of 9296 patients (4886 in the SGA group and 4410 in the TI group) were enrolled (median age, 73 years; 3373 were women [36.3\%]), and the modified Rankin Scale score was known for 9289 patients. In the SGA group, 311 of 4882 patients (6.4\%) had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) vs 300 of 4407 patients (6.8\%) in the TI group (adjusted risk difference [RD], -0.6\% [95\% CI, -1.6\% to 0.4\%]). Initial ventilation was successful in 4255 of 4868 patients (87.4\%) in the SGA group compared with 3473 of 4397 patients (79.0\%) in the TI group (adjusted RD, 8.3\% [95\% CI, 6.3\% to 10.2\%]). However, patients randomized to receive TI were less likely to receive advanced airway management (3419 of 4404 patients [77.6\%] vs 4161 of 4883 patients [85.2\%] in the SGA group). Two of the secondary outcomes (regurgitation and aspiration) were not significantly different between groups (regurgitation: 1268 of 4865 patients [26.1\%] in the SGA group vs 1072 of 4372 patients [24.5\%] in the TI group; adjusted RD, 1.4\% [95\% CI, -0.6\% to 3.4\%]; aspiration: 729 of 4824 patients [15.1\%] vs 647 of 4337 patients [14.9\%], respectively; adjusted RD, 0.1\% [95\% CI, -1.5\% to 1.8\%]).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomization to a strategy of advanced airway management with a supraglottic airway device compared with tracheal intubation did not result in a favorable functional outcome at 30 days.

	abstract = {AIM: The cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines recommend that endotracheal intubation (ETI) should be performed only by highly skilled rescuers. However, the definition of 'highly skilled' is unclear. This study evaluated how much experience with ETI is required for rescuers to perform successful ETI quickly without complications including serious chest compression interruption (interruption time {\textless}10 s) or oesophageal intubation during CPR.
METHODS: This was a clinical observation study using review of CPR video clips in an urban emergency department (ED) over 2 years. Accumulated ETI experience and performance of ETI were analysed. Main outcomes were 1) 'qualified ETI': successful ETI within 60 s without complications and 2) 'highly qualified ETI': successful ETI within 30 s without complications.
RESULTS: We analysed 110 ETIs using direct laryngoscopy during CPR. The success rate improved and the time to successful ETI decreased with increasing experience; however, the total interruption time of chest compression did not decrease. A 90\% success rate for qualified ETI required 137 experiences of ETIs (1218 days of training). A 90\% success rate for highly qualified ETI required at least 243 experiences of ETIs (1973 days of training).
CONCLUSIONS: Accumulated experience can improve the ETI success rate and time to successful ETI during CPR. Because ETI must be performed quickly without serious interruption of chest compression during CPR, becoming proficient at ETI requires more experience than that required for non-arrest patients. In our analysis, more than 240 experiences were required to achieve a 90\% success rate of highly qualified ETI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with chest pain represent a significant proportion of attendances to the ED. The History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors and Troponin (HEART) Score is validated for the risk stratification of suspected ischaemic chest pain within the ED. The goal of this research was to establish the interoperator reliability of the HEART Score as performed in the ED by different grades of doctor and nurse.
METHODOLOGY: Patients with suspected ischaemic chest pain presenting to the ED of an inner city, London Hospital, were recruited prospectively between January and May 2016. Patients that had been enrolled in the study were interviewed by clinicians from four different categories: senior doctor, junior doctor, senior nurse and junior nurse. Clinicians, blinded to other raters' results, calculated the HEART Scores for each patient with the assistance of a pocket-sized HEART Score card. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated as the primary measure of reliability. 120 patients were required to achieve a desired power of 80\%.
RESULTS: 88 complete comparisons were obtained. There were no significant differences between the distributions of HEART Scores for each clinician group (p=0.95). The ICC for the overall HEART Score was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.87 to 0.93). The ICC for troponin and age were '1', for 'history' 0.41 (95\% CI 0.30 to 0.52), 'ECG' 0.64 (95\% CI 0.54 to0.73) and 'risk factors' 0.84 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.89).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates very strong overall interoperator reliability between the four groups of clinicians studied. This suggests that the HEART Score is reproducible when used by different professional groups and grade of clinician.},

	abstract = {Background Because clinicians fear missing occult cervical-spine injuries, they obtain cervical radiographs for nearly all patients who present with blunt trauma. Previous research suggests that a set of clinical criteria (decision instrument) can identify patients who have an extremely low probability of injury and who consequently have no need for imaging studies.
Methods We conducted a prospective, observational study of such a decision instrument at 21 centers across the United States. The decision instrument required patients to meet five criteria in order to be classified as having a low probability of injury: no midline cervical tenderness, no focal neurologic deficit, normal alertness, no intoxication, and no painful, distracting injury. We examined the performance of the decision instrument in 34,069 patients who underwent radiography of the cervical spine after blunt trauma.
Results The decision instrument identified all but 8 of the 818 patients who had cervical-spine injury (sensitivity, 99.0 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 98.0 to 99.6 percent]). The negative predictive value was 99.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 99.6 to 100 percent), the specificity was 12.9 percent, and the positive predictive value was 2.7 percent. Only two of the patients classified as unlikely to have an injury according to the decision instrument met the preset definition of a clinically significant injury (sensitivity, 99.6 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 98.6 to 100 percent]; negative predictive value, 99.9 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 99.8 to 100 percent]; specificity, 12.9 percent; positive predictive value, 1.9 percent), and only one of these two patients received surgical treatment. According to the results of assessment with the decision instrument, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in the cases of 4309 (12.6 percent) of the 34,069 evaluated patients.
Conclusions A simple decision instrument based on clinical criteria can help physicians to identify reliably the patients who need radiography of the cervical spine after blunt trauma. Application of this instrument could reduce the use of imaging in such patients. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:94-9.)},

However, the degree of adherence to this guideline in clinical practice is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to the Choosing Wisely campaign’s recommendations regarding head CT imaging of patients with minor head injury in the ED.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients at a Level I trauma center. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who presented to the ED with minor head injury were identified via International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Medical record abstraction was conducted to determine the presence of clinical symptoms of the NEXUS II criteria, medical resource use, and head CT findings. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study sample, and proportions were used to quantify guidelines adherence.
Results: A total of 489 subjects met inclusion criteria. ED providers appropriately applied the Choosing Wisely criteria for 75.5\% of patients, obtaining head CTs when indicated by the NEXUS II rule (41.5\%), and not obtaining head CTs when the NEXUS II criteria were not met (34.0\%). However, ED providers obtained non-indicated CTs in 23.1\% of patients. Less than 2\% of the sample did not receive a head CT when imaging was indicated by NEXUS II.
Conclusion: ED providers in our sample had variable adherence to the Choosing Wisely head-CT recommendation, especially for patients who did not meet the NEXUS II criteria. [West J Emerg Med. 2017;18(5)821-829.]},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to understand safety climate in the United States (U.S.) fire service, which responded to more than 31 million calls to the 9-1-1 emergency response system in 2013. The majority of those calls (68 \%) were for medical assistance, while only 4 \% of calls were fire-related, highlighting that the 9-1-1 system serves as a critical public health safety net. We conducted focus groups and interviews with 123 firefighters from 12 fire departments across the United States. Using an iterative analytic approach supported by NVivo 10 software, we developed consensus regarding key themes. Firefighters concurred that the 9-1-1 system is strained and increasingly called upon to deliver Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the community. Much like the hospital emergency department, EMS frequently assists low-income and elderly populations who have few alternative sources of support. Firefighters highlighted the high volume of low-acuity calls that occupy much of their workload, divert resources from true emergencies, and lead to unwarranted occupational hazards like speeding to respond to non-serious calls. As a result, firefighters reported high occupational stress, low morale, and desensitization to community needs. Firefighters’ called for improvements to the 9-1-1 system—the backbone of emergency response in the U.S.—including better systems of triage, more targeted use of EMS resources, continuing education to align with job demands, and a strengthened social safety net to address the persistent needs of poor and elderly populations.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The prevalence of the junctional ST-depression with tall symmetrical T-waves in a field triage system for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is unknown.
Material and methods
We prospectively collected all transmitted 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) from the STEMI field triage system in Amsterdam from 2011 to 2013. Electrocardiograms with junctional ST-depression with tall symmetrical T-waves were recognized and angiographic documentation and clinical follow up were collected.
Results
A total of 5588 patients with at least 1 transmitted field ECG were identified from the database. ST-elevation infarction was present on the field ECG in 1864 patients (33\%) and 701 ECGs (12,5\%) showed anterior infarction. In 11 patients, junctional ST-depression with tall symmetrical T-waves was identified (0,2\% of total transmitted ECGs and 1,6\% of anterior infarctions). The 11 angiograms invariably showed involvement of the proximal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery (segment 5,6 and 7). Mortality was 27\% within the first week.
Conclusions
An ECG with junctional ST-depression with tall symmetrical T-waves is an infrequent finding. Because this pattern of STEMI equivalent is associated with LAD occlusions, it is important to recognize this pattern, so patients can be transported to the catheterization laboratory without delay.},

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

	abstract = {Background
A vertical incision is recommended for cricothyroidotomy when the anatomy is impalpable, but no evidence-based guideline exists regarding optimum site or length. The Difficult Airway Society guidelines, which are based on expert opinion, recommend an 80–100 mm vertical caudad to cephalad incision in the extended neck position. However, the guidelines do not advise the incision commencement point. We sought to determine the minimum incision length and commencement point above the suprasternal notch required to ensure that the cricothyroid membrane would be accessible within its margins.
Methods
We measured using ultrasound, in 80 subjects (40 males and 40 females) without airway pathology, the distance between the suprasternal notch and the cricothyroid membrane, in the neutral and extended neck positions. We assessed the inclusion of the cricothyroid membrane within theoretical incisions of 0–100 mm in length made at 10 mm intervals above the suprasternal notch.
Results
In 80 subjects (40 males and 40 females), the distance ranged from 27 to 105 mm. Movement of the cricothyroid membrane on transition from the neutral to extended neck position varied from 15 mm caudad to 27 mm cephalad. The minimum incision required in the extended position was 70 mm in males and 80 mm in females, commencing 30 mm above the suprasternal notch.
Conclusions
An 80 mm incision commencing 30 mm above the suprasternal notch would include all cricothyroid membrane locations in the extended position in patients without airway pathology, which is in keeping with the Difficult Airway Society guidelines recommended incision length.},

For the prevention of cybersecurity incidents, it is important to recognize the complexity of the operational environment as well as to catalog the technical vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity protection is not just a technical issue; it is a richer and more intricate problem to solve. A review of the factors that contribute to such a potentially insecure environment, together with the identification of the vulnerabilities, is important for understanding why these vulnerabilities persist and what the solution space should look like. This multifaceted problem must be viewed from a systemic perspective if adequate protection is to be put in place and patient safety concerns addressed. This requires technical controls, governance, resilience measures, consolidated reporting, context expertise, regulation, and standards. It is evident that a coordinated, proactive approach to address this complex challenge is essential. In the interim, patient safety is under threat.},

SUMMARY: ECPR offers a promising mechanism to mitigate multiorgan injury and allow time for the institution of supportive interventions required to effectively treat cardiac arrest. More prospective data in the context of extensive prehospital and hospital collaboration is needed to promote its successful use.},

	abstract = {Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has been performed with increasing frequency worldwide to improve the low survival rate of conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). Several studies have shown that among patients who experience in-hospital cardiac arrest, better survival outcomes and neurological outcomes can be expected after ECPR than after CCPR. However, studies have not clearly shown a short-term survival benefit of ECPR for patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Favorable outcomes are associated with a shorter low-flow time, an initial shockable rhythm, lower serum lactate levels, higher blood pH, and a lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Indications for ECPR include young age, witnessed arrest with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, an initial shockable rhythm, correctable causes such as a cardiac etiology, and no return of spontaneous circulation within 10-20 minutes of CCPR. ECPR is a complex intervention that requires a highly trained team, specialized equipment, and multidisciplinary support within a healthcare system, and it has the risk of several life-threatening complications. Therefore, physicians should carefully select patients for ECPR who can gain the most benefit, instead of applying ECPR indiscriminately.},

We sought to identify the characteristics of cardiac arrest patients presenting to our institution to begin assessing the feasibility of an ECPR program.
METHODS: This retrospective health records review included patients aged 18-75 years old presenting to our academic teaching hospital campuses with refractory nontraumatic out-of-hospital or in-emergency department (ED) cardiac arrest over a 2-year period. Based on a scoping review of the literature, both "liberal" and "restrictive" ECPR criteria were defined and applied to our cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 179 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 years, and patients were predominantly male (72.6\%). The initial rhythm was ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in 49.2\%. The majority of arrests were witnessed (69.3\%), with immediate bystander CPR performed on 53.1\% and an additional 12\% receiving CPR within 10 minutes of collapse. Median prehospital time was 40 minutes (interquartile range, 31-53.3). Two-thirds of patients (65.9\%) were identified as having a reversible cause of arrest and favorable premorbid status was identified in nearly three quarters (74.3\%). Our two sets of ECPR inclusion criteria revealed that 33 and 5 patients (liberal and restrictive criteria, respectively), would have been candidates for ECPR.
CONCLUSION: At our institution, we estimate between 6\% and 40\% of ED refractory cardiac arrest patients would be candidates for ECPR. These findings suggest that the implementation of an ECPR program should be explored.},

METHODS: Retrospective database analysis of prospective observational cohorts of patients undergoing ECPR (January 2012-December 2016) was performed. The primary outcome was 3-month favorable neurologic outcome (FO), defined as the cerebral performance categories of 1-2. Survival to ICU discharge and the number of patients undergoing organ donation were secondary outcomes. A subgroup of patients with stringent selection criteria (i.e., age ≤ 65 years, witnessed bystander CPR, no major co-morbidity and ECMO implemented within 1 h from arrest) was also analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 423 patients treated with ECPR were included (median age 57 [48-65] years; male gender 78\%); ECPR was initiated for OHCA in 258 (61\%) patients. Time from arrest to ECMO implementation was 65 [48-84] min. Eighty patients (19\%) had favorable neurological outcome. ICU survival was 24\% (n = 102); 23 (5\%) non-survivors underwent organ donation procedures. Favorable neurological outcome rate was lower (9\% vs. 34\%, p {\textless} 0.01) in out-of-hospital than in-hospital cardiac arrest and was significantly associated with shorter time from collapse to ECMO. The application of stringent ECPR criteria (n = 105) resulted in 38\% of patients with favorable neurologic outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: ECPR was associated with intact neurological recovery in 19\% of unselected cardiac arrest victims, with 38\% favorable outcome if stringent selection criteria would have been applied.},

However, the ability of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) to modulate this decline is unknown. We aimed to examine the effects of resuscitation duration on survival and metabolic profile in patients who undergo ECPR for refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (VF/VT OHCA). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated survival in 160 consecutive adults with refractory VF/VT OHCA treated with the UMN-ECPR protocol (transport with ongoing CPR to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for ECPR) compared with 654 adults who had received standard CPR in the amiodarone arm of the ALPS trial. We evaluated the metabolic changes and rate of survival in relation to duration of CPR in UMN-ECPR patients. Results: Neurologically favorable survival was significantly higher in UMN-ECPR patients vs. ALPS patients (33\% vs. 23\%; p = 0.01) overall. The mean duration of CPR was also significantly longer for UMN-ECPR patients vs. ALPS patients (60 vs. 35 min; p {\textless} 0.001). Analysis of the effect of CPR duration on neurologically favorable survival demonstrated significantly higher neurologically favorable survival for UMN-ECPR patients compared to ALPS patients at each CPR duration interval less than 60 minutes; however, longer CPR duration was associated with progressive decline in neurologically favorable survival in both groups. All UMN-ECPR patients with 20-29 minutes of CPR (8/8) survived with neurologically favorable status compared to 24\% (24/102) for ALPS patients with the same duration of CPR. There were no neurologically favorable survivors in the ALPS cohort with CPR \{greater than or equal to\}40 minutes, whereas neurologically favorable survival was 25\% (9/36) for UMN-ECPR patients with 50-59 minutes of CPR and 19\% with \{greater than or equal to\}60 minutes. Relative risk of mortality or poor neurologic function was significantly reduced in UMN-ECPR patients with CPR duration \{greater than or equal to\} 60 minutes, Significant metabolic changes included decline in pH, increased lactic acid and paCO2, and thickened left ventricular wall with prolonged professional CPR. Conclusions: ECPR was associated with improved neurologically favorable survival at all CPR durations less than 60 minutes despite severe progressive metabolic derangement. However, CPR duration remains a critical determinate of survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, a series of studies have been conducted to investigate the association of the common biochemical biomarkers, such as serum lactate and creatinine, with clinical outcomes in cardiac arrest patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), however, the results were not consistent and the sample size of primary studies is limited. In the present study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations. METHODS: Relevant studies in English databases (PubMed, ISI web of science, and Embase) and Chinese databases (Wanfang and CNKI) up to January 2018 were systematically searched. Crude ORs or HRs from the included studies were extracted and pooled to summarize the associations of lactate and creatinine with clinical outcomes including survival and neurological outcomes in ECMO treated cardiac arrest patients. RESULTS: 17 papers containing 903 cases were included in the present meta-analysis study. After pooling all the eligible studies, we identified the significant associations of high lactate level with poor survival (N=13, OR=1.335, 95\%CI=1.167-1.527, P{\textless}0.001) and poor neurological outcome (N=2, HR=1.058, 95\%CI=1.020-1.098, P=0.002) in CA patients treated with ECMO and a slight significant association of high creatinine with poor survival was also found (N=7, OR=1.010, 95\%CI=1.002-1.018, P=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: High serum lactate level was associated with poor survival and poor neurological outcome in CA patients treated with ECMO. Further well-designed studies with larger sample size should be conducted to confirm the results.},

	abstract = {Aim
To assess the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), compared with manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in adults and children.
Methods
The PRISMA guidelines were followed. We searched Medline, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published before May 22, 2018. The population included adult and pediatric patients with OHCA and IHCA of any origin. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. Outcomes included short-term and long-term survival and favorable neurological outcome.
Results
We included 25 observational studies, of which 15 studies were in adult OHCA, 7 studies were in adult IHCA, and 3 studies were in pediatric IHCA. There were no studies in pediatric OHCA. No randomized trials were included. Results from individual studies were largely inconsistent, although several studies in adult and pediatric IHCA were in favor of ECPR. The risk of bias for individual studies was overall assessed to be critical, with confounding being the primary source of bias. The overall quality of evidence was assessed to be very low. Heterogeneity across studies precluded any meaningful meta-analyses.
Conclusions
There is inconclusive evidence to either support or refute the use of ECPR for OHCA and IHCA in adults and children. The quality of evidence across studies is very low.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-assisted CPR (ECPR) is an evolving adjunct for resuscitation of OHCA patients. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess survival-to-hospital discharge with good neurologic recovery after OHCA among patients treated with ECPR compared to conventional CPR (CCPR).
METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE® and EMBASE® electronic databases was performed from inception until July 2016 to identify studies reporting ECPR use in adults with OHCA and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 1512 citations identified, 75 studies met our inclusion criteria (63 case series and 12 cohort studies). Among case series, 0 to 71.4\% of patients treated with ECPR survived to discharge with a good neurologic outcome. Subgroup analysis of the cohort studies demonstrated survival-to-hospital discharge with good neurologic recovery in the ECPR group ranging from 8.3 to 41.6\% compared to 1.5 to 9.1\% in the CCPR group. Five cohort studies adjusted for confounders, 3 of which demonstrated significantly increased adjusted odds ratios of survival among the ECPR-treated patients. Due to significant heterogeneity (I2 = 63\%, p = 0.03), pooling of outcomes and a meta-analysis were not conducted.
CONCLUSION: Although a trend towards improved survival with good neurologic outcome was reported in controlled, low-risk of bias cohort studies, a preponderance of low quality evidence may ascribe an optimistic effect size of ECPR on survival among OHCA patients. Our confidence in a clinically relevant difference in outcomes compared to current standards of care for OHCA remains weak. In this state of equipoise, high quality RCT data is urgently needed.},

RESULTS: In six studies 2 260 patients were enrolled to study the survival rate to discharge and long-term neurological outcome published since 2000. A significant effect of ECPR was observed on survival rate to discharge compared to CCPR in CA patients (RR 2.37, 95\%CI 1.63-3.45, P{\textless}0.001), and patients who underwent ECPR had a better long-term neurological outcome than those who received CCPR (RR 2.79, 95\%CI 1.96-3.97, P{\textless}0.001). In subgroup analysis, there was a significant difference in survival to discharge favoring ECPR over CCPR group in OHCA patients (RR 2.69, 95\%CI 1.48-4.91, P=0.001).

	abstract = {AIM: Extracorporeal resuscitation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) deploys rapid cardiopulmonary bypass to sustain oxygenated circulation until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The purpose of this systematic review is to address the defining elements and outcomes (quality survival and organ donation) of currently active protocols for ECPR in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of cardiac origin in adult patients. The results may inform policy and practices for ECPR and help clarify the corrresponding intersection with deceased organ donation. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and seven other electronic databases from 2005 to 2015, with no language restrictions. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes and guidelines were assessed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015259). RESULTS: One guideline and 20 outcome studies were analyzed. Half of the studies were prospective observational studies assessed to be of fair to good methodological quality. The remainder were retrospective cohorts, case series, and case studies. Ages ranged from 16 to 75 years and initial shockable cardiac rhythms, witnessed events, and a reversible primary cause of cardiac arrest were considered favorable prognostic factors. CPR duration and time to hospital cannulation varied considerably. Coronary revascularization, hemodynamic interventions and targeted temperature management neuroprotection were variable. A total of 833 patients receiving this ECPR approach had an overall reported survival rate of 22\%, including 13\% with good neurological recovery. Additionally, 88 potential and 17 actual deceased organ donors were identified among the non-survivor population in 8 out of 20 included studies. Study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis preventing any meaningful comparison between protocols, interventions and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: ECPR is feasible for refractory OHCA of cardiac origin in adult patients. It may enable neurologically good survival in selected patients, who practically have no other alternative in order to save their lives with quality of life, and contribute to organ donation in those who die. Large, prospective studies are required to clarify patient selection, modifiable outcome variables, risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Aim
Although favourable outcomes in patients receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have been frequently reported in Japanese journals since the late 1980s, there has been no meta-analysis of ECPR in Japan. This study reviewed and analysed all previous studies in Japan to clarify the survival rate of patients receiving ECPR.
Material and methods
Case reports, case series and abstracts of scientific meetings of ECPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest written in Japanese between 1983 and 2008 were collected. The characteristics and outcomes of patients were investigated, and the influence of publication bias of the case-series studies was examined by the funnel-plot method.
Results
There were 1282 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, who received ECPR in 105 reports during the period. The survival rate at discharge given for 516 cases was 26.7±1.4\%. The funnel plot presented the relationship between the number of cases of each report and the survival rate at discharge as the reverse-funnel type that centred on the average survival rate. In-depth review of 139 cases found that the rates of good recovery, mild disability, severe disability, vegetative state, death at hospital discharge and non-recorded in all cases were 48.2\%, 2.9\%, 2.2\%, 2.9\%, 37.4\% and 6.4\%, respectively.
Conclusions
Based on the results of previous reports with low publication bias in Japan, ECPR appears to provide a higher survival rate with excellent neurological outcome in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) compared the clinical efficacy of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) with conventional CPR (CCPR) for adult patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital CA (OHCA). METHODS: A literature search was used to identify eligible publications (up to 30 July 2018) from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase. Two investigators independently conducted the literature search, study selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation. Meta-analysis and TSA were used to analyze each outcome, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The primary outcome was 30-day survival, and the secondary outcomes were 30-day neurologic outcome, 3-6 months' survival, 3-6 months' neurological outcome, 1-year survival, and 1-year neurological outcome. RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible observational studies for the final analysis. Pooled analyses showed that ECPR was associated with a significantly better 30-day survival (RR = 1.60, 95\% CI = 1.25-2.06) and 30-day neurologic outcome (RR = 2.69, 95\% CI = 1.63-4.46), and TSA confirmed these results. However, subgroup analysis of patients with OHCA indicated that ECPR and CCPR had similar effects on 30-day survival (RR = 1.18, 95\% CI = 0.71-1.97), which was not confirmed by TSA. Analysis of OHCA patients indicated that ECPR provided a better 30-day neurological outcome (RR = 3.93, 95\% CI = 1.00-15.50), but TSA did not support these results. Analysis of IHCA patients indicated that ECPR was associated with a better 30-day survival (RR 1.90, 95\% CI 1.43-2.52) and 30-day neurologic outcome (RR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.21-3.39), and TSA supported these results. Other subgroup analyses showed that the results were generally consistent, regardless of nation, propensity score matching, presumed etiology, whether the CA was witnessed or not, and study quality. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to CCPR, ECPR improved the survival and neurological outcome of patients who had IHCA. Compared to IHCA patients, TSA could not confirm better survival and neurologic outcome of ECPR in OHCA patients, suggesting that further studies are needed.

To assess the clinical outcomes of the use of ECMO in this modality and to look for predictors of mortality, we performed a meta-analysis (MA) of individual patients collected from observational studies. An electronic PubMed search restricted to English-language publications between 1990 and 2007, using a consensus restrictive criterion, retrieved 141 titles. After full text evaluation, 11 clinical series and nine case reports were considered appropriate and included in our MA. Data on 135 individually identified adult patients (male:female = 1.6:1) were collected. Median age for the group was 56 years (range 18-83), and the median ECMO run was 54 hours (range 0-3881). Overall survival to hospital discharge was 40\% (54 of 135). The most common diagnosis leading to cardiac arrest was acute myocardial infarction (46 of 135 patients). Compared with the youngest group (17-41 years), odds ratio (OR) for mortality was higher for age group 41-56 years (OR 2.9 95\%; CL, 1.6-8.2) and those older than 67 years (OR 3.4\%; 95\% CL, 1.2-9.7). Duration of ECMO support measured in days was also a predictor of mortality, with significant better outcome for those supported between 0.875 and 2.3 days (OR 0.2; 95\% CL, 0.07-0.6). There was a negative trend in survival when manual CPR lasted {\textgreater}30 minutes without prompt ECMO initiation (OR 1.9; 95\% CL, 0.9-4.2). This work confirms the expectations for a better survival when E-CPR is used in younger patients, for shorter periods of time and after expeditious implementation during or immediately after manual CPR. Neurologic sequelae and other major complications, although suspected to be high, are poorly described in the reviewed literature.},

METHODS: We searched the relevant literature of comparative studies between ECPR and CCPR in adults, from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The baseline information and outcome data (survival, good neurologic outcome at discharge, at 3-6 months, and at 1 year after arrest) were extracted. Beneficial effect of ECPR on outcome was analyzed according to time interval, location of arrest (out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA)), and pre-defined population inclusion criteria (witnessed arrest, initial shockable rhythm, cardiac etiology of arrest and CPR duration) by using Review Manager 5.3. Cochran's Q test and I(2) were calculated.
RESULTS: 10 of 1583 publications were included. Although survival to discharge did not show clear superiority in OHCA, ECPR showed statistically improved survival and good neurologic outcome as compared to CCPR, especially at 3-6 months after arrest. In the subgroup of patients with pre-defined inclusion criteria, the pooled meta-analysis found similar results in studies with pre-defined criteria.
CONCLUSION: Survival and good neurologic outcome tended to be superior in the ECPR group at 3-6 months after arrest. The effect of ECPR on survival to discharge in OHCA was not clearly shown. As ECPR showed better outcomes than CCPR in studies with pre-defined criteria, strict indications criteria should be considered when implementation of ECPR.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Association estimates between baseline characteristics and outcomes are imprecise and inconsistent among extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) recipients following refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of pre-specified characteristics for OHCA treated with ECPR.
METHODS: The Medline electronic database was searched via PubMed for articles published from January 2000 to September 2016. The electronic search was supplemented by scanning the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacting field experts. Eligible studies were historical and prospective cohort studies of adult patients undergoing ECPR following OHCA.
RESULTS: Fifteen primary studies were included, totaling 841 participants. The median prevalence of the primary outcome (i.e., short- or long-term survival for five studies and cerebral performance for ten studies) was 15\% (range, 0-50\%). The primary outcome was associated with an increased odds ratio of initial shockable cardiac rhythm (2.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.72; P=0.003), shorter low-flow duration (geometric mean ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.99; P=0.04), higher arterial pH value (difference, 0.12; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.22; P=0.01) and lower serum lactate concentration (difference, -3.52mmol/L; 95\% CI, -5.05 to -1.99; P{\textless}0.001). No significant association was found between the primary outcome and patient age (the odds of female gender and bystander CPR attempt.
CONCLUSION: Observational evidence from published primary studies indicates that shorter low-flow duration, shockable cardiac rhythm, higher arterial pH value and lower serum lactate concentration on hospital admission are associated with better outcomes for ECPR recipients after OHCA.},

	abstract = {Aims
To identify the predictors of survival to discharge in adults resuscitated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA).
Methods
MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science were searched for eligible studies. Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and Pooled Mean Difference (PMD) for each predictor were calculated. The quality of evidence (QOE) was evaluated according to the GRADE guidelines.
Results
Eleven studies were included totalling 856 patients. Of these, 324 (37.9\%) survived to discharge. Good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) occurred in 222/263 (84.4\%) survivors. Survival was associated with significantly higher odds of an initial shockable rhythm (OR 1.65; 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI] 1.05–2.61; p=0.03), shorter low-flow time (PMD −17.15 [−20.90, −13.40]min; p{\textless}0.00001), lower lactate levels both immediately before ECPR start (PMD −4.12 [−6.0,−2.24]mmol/L; p{\textless}0.0001) and on ICU admission (PMD −4.13 [−6.38, −1.88]mmol/L; p{\textless}0.0003), lower SOFA score (PMD −1.71 [−2.93, −0.50]; p=0.006) and lower creatinine levels within 24h after ICU admission (PMD −0.37 [−0.54, −0.19]mg/dl; p{\textless}0.00001). No significant association was found between survival and age, gender, or cardiac vs. non-cardiac aetiology. The overall QOE was low or very low.
Conclusions
In adult IHCA treated with ECPR a shockable initial rhythm, a lower low-flow time, lower blood lactate levels before ECPR start or on ICU admission, and a lower SOFA score or creatinine levels in the first 24h after ICU admission were associated with a higher likelihood of survival. These factors could help identifying patients who are eligible for ECPR.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The probability of surviving a cardiac arrest remains low. International
resuscitation guidelines state that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (ECPR) may have a role in selected patients suffering
refractory cardiac arrest. Identifying these patients is challenging. This
project systematically reviewed the evidence comparing the outcomes of ECPR
over conventional-CPR (CCPR), before examining resuscitation-specific
parameters to assess which patients might benefit from ECPR.

Method
Literature searches of studies comparing ECPR to CCPR and the clinical
parameters of survivors of ECPR were performed. The primary outcome examined
was survival at hospital discharge or 30 days. A secondary analysis examined
the resuscitation parameters that may be associated with survival in
patients who receive ECPR (no-flow and low-flow intervals, bystander-CPR,
initial shockable cardiac rhythm, and witnessed cardiac arrest).

Results
Seventeen of 948 examined studies were included. ECPR demonstrated improved
survival (OR 0.40 (0.27–0.60)) and a better neurological outcome (OR 0.10
(0.04–0.27)) over CCPR during literature review and meta-analysis.
Characteristics that were associated with improved survival in patients
receiving ECPR included an initial shockable rhythm and a shorter low-flow
time. Shorter no-flow, the presence of bystander-CPR and witnessed arrests
were not characteristics that were associated with improved survival
following meta-analysis, although the quality of input data was low. All
data were non-randomised, and hence the potential for bias is high.

Conclusion
ECPR is a sophisticated treatment option which may improve outcomes in a
selected patient population in refractory cardiac arrest. Further
comparative research is needed clarify the role of this potential
resuscitative therapy.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ajem.2018.05.009},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biphasic reaction is a feared complication of anaphylaxis management in the emergency department (ED). The traditional recommended ED observation time is 4-6 h after complete resolution of symptoms for every anaphylaxis patient. However, there has been great controversy regarding whether this standard of care is evidence-based.
METHODS: Articles were selected using a PubMed, MEDLINE search for the keywords "biphasic anaphylaxis", yielding 155 articles. Articles were filtered by English language, and the keyword biphasic in the title. Case reports and case series were excluded, narrowing to 33 articles. Then, articles were filtered by relevance to the ED setting, and studies conducted in outpatient clinic settings were excluded, narrowing the search to 16 articles. All remaining articles were reviewed and findings were discussed.
RESULTS: The reported mean time to onset between the resolution of initial anaphylaxis and biphasic reaction ranges widely by study from 1 to 72 h with the majority of studies reporting the mean time to onset {\textgreater}8 h. A delay between anaphylaxis symptom onset and administration of epinephrine of 60-190 min was reported to correlate with biphasic anaphylaxis in three studies. Anaphylaxis requiring {\textgreater}1 dose of epinephrine to achieve symptom resolution was also reported to correlate with biphasic reactions in two studies. No definitive conclusions about the role of corticosteroids in preventing biphasic reactions can be made at this time however; a couple small studies have shown that they may decrease the incidence of biphasic reactions. Additional risk factors correlated with biphasic reaction vary widely between studies and the generalizability of these risk factors is questionable.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for further research to identify true risk factors associated with biphasic anaphylaxis and to clearly define the role of corticosteroids in biphasic reactions. However, given the low incidence and rare mortality of biphasic reactions, patients who receive epinephrine within one hour of symptom onset and who respond to epinephrine with rapid and complete symptom resolution can probably be discharged from the ED with careful return precautions and education without the need for prolonged observation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergency medical dispatchers fail to identify approximately 25\% of cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest, thus lose the opportunity to provide the caller instructions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We examined whether a machine learning framework could recognize out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from audio files of calls to the emergency medical dispatch center.
METHODS: For all incidents responded to by Emergency Medical Dispatch Center Copenhagen in 2014, the associated call was retrieved. A machine learning framework was trained to recognize cardiac arrest from the recorded calls. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for recognizing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were calculated. The performance of the machine learning framework was compared to the actual recognition and time-to-recognition of cardiac arrest by medical dispatchers.
RESULTS: We examined 108,607 emergency calls, of which 918 (0.8\%) were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls eligible for analysis. Compared with medical dispatchers, the machine learning framework had a significantly higher sensitivity (72.5\% vs. 84.1\%, p {\textless} 0.001) with lower specificity (98.8\% vs. 97.3\%, p {\textless} 0.001). The machine learning framework had a lower positive predictive value than dispatchers (20.9\% vs. 33.0\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Time-to-recognition was significantly shorter for the machine learning framework compared to the dispatchers (median 44 seconds vs. 54 s, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning framework performed better than emergency medical dispatchers for identifying out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in emergency phone calls. Machine learning may play an important role as a decision support tool for emergency medical dispatchers.},

Undertriage was deﬁned as nontrauma centers treatment with an Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 16, consistent with the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma benchmark. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds of undertriage by census region, adjusting for sex, race, age, Injury Severity Score, trauma center proximity, and mode of transportation.
Results: Forty-six percent of severely injured patients (n¼125,731) were treated at a nontrauma center. Compared with that for patients in the Midwest, adjusted odds of undertriage were 100\% higher for patients in Southern states (odds ratio [OR] 2.00; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] 2.00 to 2.04) and 78\% higher in Western states (OR 1.78; 95\% CI 1.73 to 1.82). Compared with that for patients aged 65 to 69 years, odds of undertriage gradually increased in all age groups, reaching 57\% for patients older than 80 years (OR 1.57; 95\% CI 1.52 to 1.61). Distance to a trauma center was associated with increasing odds of undertriage, with 37\% higher odds (OR 1.37; 95\% CI 1.15 to 1.40) for older adults living more than 30 miles from a trauma center compared with patients living within 15 miles.
Conclusion: Nearly half of older adult trauma patients are undertriaged; it increases with age and distance to care and is most common in Southern and Western states. Improvements to ﬁeld triage and trauma center access for older patients are urgently needed. [Ann Emerg Med. 2019;-:1-11.]},

Methods: Between December 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018, 100 consecutive adult T patients with refractory VF/VT out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and ongoing CPR were transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. ECMO, coronary angiography, and IP percutaneous coronary intervention were performed. Patients achieving an organized cardiac rhythm were admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). All patients were R considered eligible for necessary intervention/surgery until declaration of death. C Results: Of 100 appropriately transported patients, 83 achieved CICU admission. 40/83 (48\%) discharged functionally intact. Multi-system organ failure occurred in all patients. S Cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and liver injury improved within 3-4 days. Neurologic injury caused death in 26/37 (70\%) patients. Poor neurologic outcomes were associated with U anoxic injury or cerebral edema on admission head CT, decline in cerebral oximetry over N the first 48 hours, and elevated neuron specific enolase on CICU admission. For survivors, mean time to ECMO decannulation was 3.5 ± 0.2 days, following commands A at 5.7 ± 0.8 days, and hospital discharge at 21 ± 3.2 days. 41/83 (49\%) patients developed infections.

However, current commercially available ECMO simulation models are expensive and lack many standard cardiorespiratory resuscitative (CPR) features.
Objective: To use 3-dimensional (3D) printing to develop a training manikin for comprehensive ECPR simulation.
Methods: A standard commercially available CPR manikin with airway model was used as the base model for modification. An inexpensive 3D printer was used to print a modular plastic pelvis. A medical silicone gel incorporated silicone femoral vasculature component was manufactured with connection to a gravity fed vascular system.
Results: The resulting modified manikin included the modular in-house designed ECMO cannulation and vascular structures wedded to the commercially available airway and CPR components. In simulation exercise involving first responders, paramedics, and emergency and critical care physicians, the model was reported as realistic with ultrasound views, cannulation, and resuscitative components functional. The entire cost for development of the ECMO component was estimated at \$2000 Australian dollars AUD, including the printer purchase and supplies. Future reuse of components is estimated to cost less than \$5 AUD per simulation run.
Conclusions: A novel in-house modified manikin for ECPR was developed that was cost-efficient and realistic to use from first response through to establishment of ECMO circulation.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous reports have questioned the feasibility and gender equality of obtaining a prehospital ECG within 10 minutes of ambulance arrival for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The main objective of this study was to investigate the proportion of STEMI patients with a prehospital ECG within 10 minutes of ambulance arrival. The secondary objective was to study the gender differences in delay times in prehospital STEMI care.
Methods: This study was a retrospective study based on 539 patients with STEMI at the investigating hospital. Ambulance and medical charts, as well as the national quality registry "SWEDEHEART", were reviewed for each patient for demographics and time information.
Results: A prehospital ECG was obtained within 10 minutes of ambulance arrival for 99 (29\%) of the men and 19 (14\%) of the women, p = 0.001. Women had a 2 minutes longer delay between ambulance arrival and prehospital ECG (95\% CI 0-4 min, p = 0.018) than men. Women also had a significantly longer patient delay. None of the other time intervals differed among men and women.
Conclusions: Only for a minority of patients is a prehospital ECG taken within the recommended ten minutes from ambulance arrival. Women have longer patient delay times, as well as delay times to the acquisition of a prehospital ECG than men. Improvements of prehospital ECG acquisition and adjustments of the guidelines are warranted.},

	abstract = {Emergency departments (EDs) play a vital role in the whole healthcare system as they are the first point of care in hospitals for urgent and critically ill patients. Therefore, effective management of hospital's ED is crucial in improving the quality of the healthcare service. The effectiveness depends on how efficiently the hospital resources are used, particularly under budget constraints. Simulation modeling is one of the best methods to optimize resources and needs inputs such as patients' arrival time, patient's length of stay (LOS), and the route of patients in the ED. This study develops a simulation model to determine the optimum number of beds in an ED by minimizing the patients' LOS. The hospital data are analyzed, and patients' LOS and the route of patients in the ED are determined. To determine patients' arrival times, the features associated with patients' arrivals at ED are identified. Mean arrival rate is used as a feature in addition to climatic and temporal variables. The exhaustive feature-selection method has been used to determine the best subset of the features, and the mean arrival rate is determined as one of the most significant features. This study is executed using the one-year ED arrival data together with five-year (43.824 study hours) ED arrival data to improve the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, ten different machine learning (ML) algorithms are used utilizing the same best subset of these features. After a tenfold cross-validation experiment, based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the stateful long short-term memory (LSTM) model performed better than other models with an accuracy of 47\%, followed by the decision tree and random forest methods. Using the simulation method, the LOS has been minimized by 7\% and the number of beds at the ED has been optimized.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the medical imaging utilization and information related to patients' socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors during the patients' ED visits; and to develop predictive models using these associated factors including natural language elements to predict the medical imaging utilization at pediatric ED.
METHODS: Pediatric patients' data from the 2012-2016 United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was included to build the models to predict the use of imaging in children presenting to the ED. Multivariable logistic regression models were built with structured variables such as temperature, heart rate, age, and unstructured variables such as reason for visit, free text nursing notes and combined data available at triage. NLP techniques were used to extract information from the unstructured data.
RESULTS: Of the 27,665 pediatric ED visits included in the study, 8394 (30.3\%) received medical imaging in the ED, including 6922 (25.0\%) who had an X-ray and 1367 (4.9\%) who had a computed tomography (CT) scan. In the predictive model including only structured variables, the c-statistic was 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.70-0.71) for any imaging use, 0.69 (95\% CI: 0.68-0.70) for X-ray, and 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.78) for CT. Models including only unstructured information had c-statistics of 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.81-0.82) for any imaging use, 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.82-0.83) for X-ray, and 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.83-0.86) for CT scans. When both structured variables and free text variables were included, the c-statistics reached 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.82-0.83) for any imaging use, 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.83-0.84) for X-ray, and 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.86-0.88) for CT.
CONCLUSIONS: Both CT and X-rays are commonly used in the pediatric ED with one third of the visits receiving at least one. Patients' socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors presented at ED triage period were associated with the medical imaging utilization. Predictive models combining structured and unstructured variables available at triage performed better than models using structured or unstructured variables alone, suggesting the potential for use of NLP in determining resource utilization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However, as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause, attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation.
METHODS: First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April 2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM. Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4 machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen September 2018 data.
RESULTS: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09\% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the narrative, 57.6\% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM. Approximately 1.63\% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5\% (784/821) were considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for 2.39\% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 77.79\% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95\% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on 5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68). The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases; PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a rescue strategy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is increasingly being used for nonresponders to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To identify patients most likely to benefit from ECPR, the authors investigated predictors of hospital discharge with good neurologic function.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: Single institution academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent ECPR.
INTERVENTIONS: Venoarterial ECMO initiation for witnessed refractory cardiac arrest from 2009-2019.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and post-ECMO outcomes were compared between patients who had good versus poor neurologic function at discharge. Good neurologic function was defined as a cerebral performance category 1 to 2, whereas poor neurologic function was defined as a cerebral performance category 3 to 5. Of 54 patients, 13 (24\%) were discharged with good neurologic function and 41 (76\%) had poor neurologic function (n = 38 in-hospital deaths; n = 3 discharged with severe disability.) Survivors with good neurologic function were younger (41 v 61 y; p = 0.03), more likely to arrest because of pulmonary embolism (46\% v 10\%; p = 0.01), and more likely to receive concurrent Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) placement while on ECMO (38\% v 12\%; p = 0.03.) Young age was the most important predictor of good neurologic function (odds ratio 0.92 [0.87-0.97]; p = 0.004), with a threshold for improved survival around 60 years. For all patients, survival to discharge was 30\%; however, among survivors with good neurologic function, 5-year survival was 100\%.
CONCLUSIONS: ECPR is associated with high rates of neurologic morbidity and mortality. However, in select patients, it may be an acceptable option with favorable long-term survival. Additional studies are indicated to further define the appropriate selection criteria for ECPR implementation.},

	abstract = {Introduction There is currently no protocol for the initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Atlantic Canada. Advanced care paramedics (ACPs) perform advanced cardiac life support in the prehospital setting often completing the entire resuscitation on-scene. Implementation of ECPR will present a novel intervention that is only available at the receiving hospital. Our objective is to determine if an educational program can improve identification of ECPR candidates by paramedics. Establishing paramedic competence will ensure rapid transfer of eligible patients for a potentially life-saving intervention. Methods An educational program was delivered to paramedics including a short seminar and pocket card coupled with simulated OHCA cases. A before-and-after study design using a case-based survey was employed. Paramedics were scored on their ability to correctly identify patients suffering OHCA who met the inclusion criteria for our ECPR protocol. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was employed to compare paramedics' scores before and after the education delivery. A six-month follow-up is planned to assess retention. Qualitative data was also collected from paramedics during simulation to help identify practical issues, potential barriers, and to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to the implementation of our protocol in the prehospital setting. Results The median score pre-education was 10 (IQR: 9-10.5) compared to 14 (IQR: 13-15) after education delivery. The median difference between groups was 5. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs test demonstrated a significant improvement in the paramedics' ability to correctly identify ECPR candidates after completing our educational program z = -2.67, p = 0.0039. Conclusion Paramedic training through a didactic session coupled with a pocket card and simulation appeared to be a feasible method of knowledge translation. Six-month follow-up data will help ensure knowledge retention is achieved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (VA-ECMO) following refractory cardiogenic shock (r-CS) or cardiac arrest (r-CA) has significant morbidity and mortality. Early outcome prediction is crucial in this setting, but data on neuro-prognostication are limited. We examined the prognostic value of clinical neurological examination, using an automated device for the quantitative measurement of pupillary light reactivity.
METHODS: An observational cohort of sedated mechanically ventilated VA-ECMO patients was analyzed at the early phase following ECMO insertion (first 72 hours). Using the NPi®-200 automated infrared pupillometer, pupillary light reactivity was assessed repeatedly (every 12 hours) by calculating the Neurological Pupil index (NPi). Trends of NPi over time were correlated to 90-day mortality, and the prognostic performance of the NPi, alone and in combination with the 12-h PREDICT VA-ECMO score, was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total 100 consecutives patients were studied (51 r-CS/49 r-CA; 12-h PREDICT VA-ECMO 40\%; observed 90-day survival 43\%). Non-survivors (n=57) had significantly lower NPi than survivors at all time-points (all p{\textless}0.01). Abnormal NPi ({\textless}3, at any time from 24 to 72 hours) was 100\% specific for 90-day mortality, with 0\% false positives. Adding 12-h PREDICT VA-ECMO score to the NPi provided the best prognostic performance (specificity 100\% [95\% confidence interval 91-100\%], sensitivity 60\% [46-72\%], area under the ROC curve 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative NPi alone had excellent ability to predict a poor outcome from day 1 after VA-ECMO insertion, with no false positives. Combining NPi and 12-h PREDICT-VA ECMO score increased sensitivity of outcome prediction, while maintaining 100\% specificity.},

The aim of this study was to review the outcomes of patients initiated on ECMO support in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients ({\textgreater}18 years old) initiated on ECMO support in the cardiac catheterization laboratory from 2010-2017. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, procedural details, and indication for ECMO support were reviewed. The outcomes assessed included 30-day mortality, blood product transfusion, vascular injury, prolonged respiratory failure, stroke, ischemic bowel, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and compartment syndrome.
RESULTS: Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017, a total of 25 patients were cannulated for ECMO in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The mean age was 61 years and 56\% of patients were men. Cardiac arrest was the most frequent indication for ECMO support (64\%), followed by cardiogenic shock (28\%). The 30-day mortality rate was 40\%. The most frequent complications associated with ECMO were the need for vascular surgery (52\%) and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (36\%). The univariate predictors of 30-day mortality were age (P=.02; unit odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.15), history of tobacco use (P=.04; OR, 6; 95\% CI, 1.01-35.91), and Apache IV score (P=.02; unit OR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.09).
CONCLUSIONS: ECMO should be considered early during the resuscitation attempts of selected patients with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation or refractory cardiogenic shock in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.},

Methods and Results: We analyzed data from the Study of Advanced Life Support for Ventricular Fibrillation with Extracorporeal Circulation in Japan, which was a prospective, multicenter, observational study with 22 institutions in the ECPR group and 17 institutions in the conventional CPR (CCPR) group. Patients were divided into 4 groups by cardiac rhythm and CPR group. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2 at 6 months. A total of 407 patients had refractory OHCA with VF/pVT on initial electrocardiogram. The proportion of ECPR patients with favorable neurological outcome was significantly higher in the sustained VF/pVT group than in the conversion to PEA/asystole group (20\%, 25/126 vs. 3\%, 4/122, P{\textless}0.001). Stratifying by cardiac rhythm, on multivariable mixed logistic regression analysis an ECPR strategy significantly increased the proportion of patients with favorable neurological outcome at 6 months in the patients with sustained VF/pVT (OR, 7.35; 95\% CI: 1.58-34.09), but these associations were not observed in patients with conversion to PEA/asystole.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a risk prediction model for neurologic outcomes in patients who underwent extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).
METHODS: Between May 2004 and April 2016, a total of 274 patients who underwent ECPR were included in this analysis. The primary outcome was neurologic status on discharge from the hospital, as assessed by Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale. To develop a new predictive scoring system, backward stepwise elimination and a z-score-based scoring scheme were used on the basis of logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients (34.7\%) survived until discharge. Of these, 78 patients (28.5\%) had favorable neurologic outcomes (CPC scores of 1 or 2). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of poor neurologic outcome included age older than 65 years, initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score greater than 13 points, first monitored arrest rhythm, low-flow time longer than 30 minutes, initial pulse pressure less than 25 mm Hg, initial mean arterial pressure less than 70 mm Hg, and serum glucose level greater than 300 mg/dL. There was also a significant interaction between age and low-flow time. The newly developed neurologic outcome score after ECPR (nECPR) more effectively predicted poor neurologic outcome (C-statistic, 0.867; 95\% confidence interval, 0.823 to 0.912) than the former ECPR score (p = 0.019) and the survival after venoarterial ECMO score (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The investigators created a risk prediction model for neurologic outcomes using independent predictors and the interaction between age and low-flow time, and this new scoring system could predict early neurologic prognosis more effectively in ECPR-treated patients.

It is not known whether first documented rhythm plays a prominent role in economic outcomes of patients with cardiac arrest who received ECPR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the medical records of 120 consecutive patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) assisted CPR due to refractory circulatory collapse between 2008 and 2016 in Urasoe General Hospital. The patients presented with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT; n = 59, 49.2\%) or with asystole or pulseless electric activity (ASY/PEA; n = 61, 50.8\%) as the first documented rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified shorter duration from collapse to ECMO initiation (odds ratio, 1.95 per 10 min; 95\% confidence interval, 1.32-2.89, p = 0.001), bystander CPR (odds ratio, 5.53; 95\% confidence interval, 1.36-22.5, p = 0.017), and first documented rhythm of VF/VT (odds ratio, 3.93; 95\% confidence interval, 1.30-11.8, p = 0.015) as clinical predictors for neurologically intact survival. Total hospital cost per life saved by ECPR for ASY/PEA was approximately twice that for VF/VT (\$213,656 vs. \$101,669). ECPR yielded Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of 3.32 at a mean total cost of \$39,634 for VF/VT and QALYs of 1.17 at a mean cost of \$35,609 for ASY/PEA. The cost per QALYs was \$11,081 for VF/VT and \$29,447 for ASY/PEA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECPR vs. conventional CPR was estimated to be \$ 16,246 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: ECPR for patients presenting with VF/VT was found to be highly cost-effective and ECPR for patients presenting with ASY/PEA was borderline cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Introduction: San Diego has one of the busiest international land border crossings in the world. The epidemiology of prehospital care at the San Diego (California, United States) - Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico) border crossings are previously unreported. Investigators sought to describe prehospital care provided at the San Diego border crossings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective data collection from April 2014 to March 2017 evaluating prehospital provider (PHP) contacts at two international border crossing addresses in San Diego. The 9-1-1 dispatch center and first response were provided by a single municipal fire agency with ambulance transportation provided by a contracting private agency. Patient dispatch data and electronic patient care records were queried for patient demographics, PHP arrival time, incident complaint, assessment narrative, and treatments provided. Natural language processing techniques were applied to map the narrative to the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System. Descriptive analysis was performed in the R software program. Results: A total of 6,261 PHP patient contacts were made at the two border crossings during the study period. 87\% of the calls were at the San Ysidro border crossing compared to 13\% at Otay Mesa. The population, composed of 50.8\% males, had ages ranging from 0 days - 103 years old, with a median age of 45 years old. There were 606 (9.7\%) pediatric patients ({\textless}18 years) and 1,416 (22.6\%) geriatric patients ({\textgreater}65 years). The top three incident complaints were respiratory distress (830, 10.8\%) blunt trauma (827, 10.7\%) and abdominal pain (814, 10.6\%), and the top 3 medications provided were oxygen (481, 7.7\%), normal saline (393, 6.3\%) and ondansetron (352, 5.6\%). Conclusion: This was the first study of PHP assessment and care at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossings. We found a large diversity in patient ages. Respiratory distress and blunt trauma were the most frequent complaints and oxygen was the most frequent treatment. The busiest day of the week was Sunday, and the busiest month of the year was July. Our newly described findings may assist EMS agencies with optimizing staff, equipment, and training at international border crossings.},

	abstract = {Introduction: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a time-sensitive entity that has been shown to benefit from prehospital diagnosis by electrocardiogram (ECG). Current computer algorithms with binary decision making are not accurate enough to be relied on for cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation. Hypothesis: An algorithmic approach is proposed to stratify binary STEMI computerized ECG interpretations into low, intermediate, and high STEMI probability tiers.
Methods: Based on previous literature, a four-criteria algorithm was developed to rule out/in common causes of prehospital STEMI false-positive computer interpretations: heart rate, QRS width, ST elevation criteria, and artifact. Prehospital STEMI cases were prospectively collected at a single academic center in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) from May 2012 through October 2013. The prehospital ECGs were applied to the algorithm and compared against activation of the CCL by an emergency department (ED) physician as the outcome of interest. In addition to calculating test characteristics, linear regression was used to look for an association between number of criteria used and accuracy, and logistic regression was used to test if any single criterion performed better than another.
Results: There were 63 ECGs available for review, 39 high probability and 24 intermediate probability. The high probability STEMI tier had excellent test characteristics for ruling in STEMI when all four criteria were used, specificity 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.59-1.00), positive predictive value 1.00 (0.91-1.00). Linear regression showed a strong correlation demonstrating that false-positives increased as fewer criteria were used (adjusted r-square 0.51; P {\textless}.01). Logistic regression showed no significant predictive value for any one criterion over another (P = .80). Limiting physician overread to the intermediate tier only would reduce the number of ECGs requiring physician overread by a factor of 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.75; P {\textless}.01).
Conclusion: Prehospital STEMI ECGs can be accurately stratified to high, intermediate, and low probabilities for STEMI using the four criteria. While additional study is required, using this tiered algorithmic approach in prehospital ECGs could lead to changes in CCL activation and decreased requirements for physician overread. This may have significant clinical and quality implications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in highly selective patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is supported by previous studies; however, it is unclear whether the effects of ECLS are observed at a population level. This study aimed to determine whether ECLS is associated with improved survival outcomes compared to conventional CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) at a national level.
METHODS: We used a Korean national OHCA cohort database from 2009 to 2013. The inclusion criteria were OHCA adults with presumed cardiac aetiology and resuscitation by emergency medical services (EMS). Patients were excluded if their information on prehospital time intervals or clinical outcomes at hospital discharge was incomplete or not captured. The primary outcome was neurologically favourable survival to discharge. We compared the primary outcomes between the ECLS and non-ECLS groups using a multivariable logistic regression and a propensity score matching analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 119,077 patients with OHCA, 36,547 were included in the analysis. There were 320 patients who received ECLS. There was no significant difference in neurologically favourable survival to discharge between the ECLS group and the non-ECLS group after adjusting for covariates (adjusted OR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.41-1.04). In the propensity score-matched cohort, there was also no significant difference between the two groups (adjusted OR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.41-2.14).
CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score-matched cohort using a nationwide OHCA database, OHCA victims who received ECLS did not show better survival outcomes than those who did not receive ECLS.},

If an ECMO circuit needs to be built and primed it may add significant minutes to the response time. The purpose of this study is to test for any growth in primed ECMO circuits at given time intervals to prove the safety of leaving an ECMO circuit primed. This, in turn, may lead to decreased response time, with an arrest and the placement of the arresting patient on ECMO. Five ECMO circuits were set up, primed and sampled for bacterial growth at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours and then at one-week intervals, with an end point of four weeks. No bacterial growth was found at any point during the sampling process.},

AIMS: To describe trends in survival and patient demographics for ECPR patients in the international Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) database over the past 12 years and identify factors associated with changes in survival.
METHODS: Patients greater than 16 years of age who received ECPR between January 2003 and December 2014 were extracted from the ELSO registry and were divided into three 4-year cohorts (Cohort 1: 2003-2006, Cohort 2: 2007-2010, Cohort 3: 2011-2014). Univariable analysis was performed to compare demographics and outcomes of patients across the three cohorts. Univariable and multivariable analyses were then performed to identify factors independently associated with survival.
RESULTS: 1796 patients treated with ECPR were extracted from the registry, aged 50 (±18.5) years. Annual ECPR episodes increased over 10-fold, from 35 to over 400 per year. Survival to hospital discharge was 29\% overall (27\% cohort 1, 28\% cohort 2, 30\% cohort 3 (p=0.71)). Age, body weight and documented comorbidities increased over time. There was a reduction in complications associated with ECMO usage. After adjusting for confounders there was no change in the odds of survival over the time period examined.
INTERPRETATION: Over the period 2003-2014, survival to hospital discharge was 29\% for patients who require ECPR. Despite advances in provision of ECMO care and increasing co-morbidities of patients, there has been no change in risk-adjusted survival over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In refractory cardiac arrest, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for more than 30 min, chances of survival are small. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is an option for certain patients with cardiac arrest. The aim of this study was to evaluate characteristics of patients selected for ECPR.
METHODS: Anonymised data of adult patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest, transported with ongoing CPR to an ED of a tertiary care centre between 2002 and 2012 were analysed. Outcome measure was the selection for ECPR. Secondary outcome was 180 days survival in good neurological condition.
RESULTS: Overall, 239 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. ECPR was initiated in seven patients. Patients treated with ECPR were younger (46 vs 60 years; p=0.04), had shorter intervals before CPR was started (0 vs 1 min; p=0.013), faster admissions at the ED (38 vs 56 min; p=0.31) and lower blood glucose levels on admission (14 vs 21 mmol/L; p=0.018). Survival to discharge in good neurological condition was achieved in 14 (6\%) of all patients. One patient in the ECPR group survived in excellent neurological condition. Age was independently associated with the selection for ECPR (OR 0.07; 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.85; p=0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency extracorporeal life support was used for a highly selected group of patients in refractory cardiac arrest. Several parameters were associated with the decision, but only age was independently associated with the selection for ECPR. The patient selection resulting in a survival of one patient out of seven treated seems reasonable. Randomised controlled trials evaluating the age limit as selection criteria are urgently needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Objective: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may improve outcomes for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Transport of intra-arrest patients to hospital however, may decrease CPR quality, potentially reducing survival for those who would have achieved return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC) with further on-scene resuscitation. We examined time-to-ROSC and patient outcomes for the optimal time to consider transport. Methods: From a prospective registry of consecutive adult non-traumatic OHCA's, we identified a hypothetical ECPR-eligible cohort of EMS-treated patients with age ≤ 65, witnessed arrest, and bystander CPR or EMS arrival {\textless} 10 minutes. We assessed the relationship between time-to-ROSC and survival, and constructed a ROC curve to illustrate the ability of a pulseless state to predict non-survival with conventional resuscitation. Results: Of 6,571 EMS-treated cases, 1,206 were included with 27\% surviving. Increasing time–to–ROSC (per minute) was negatively associated with survival (adjusted OR 0.91; 95\%CI 0.89–0.93\%). The yield of survivors per minute of resuscitation increased from commencement and started to decline in the 8th minute. Fifty percent and 90\% of survivors had achieved ROSC by 8.0 and 24 min, respectively, at which times the probability of survival for those with initial shockable rhythms was 31\% and 10\%, and for non-shockable rhythms was 5.2\% and 1.6\%. The ROC curve illustrated that the 16th minute of resuscitation maximized sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.85–0.89). Conclusion: Transport for ECPR should be considered between 8 to 24 minutes of professional on-scene resuscitation, with 16 minutes balancing the risks and benefits of early and later transport. Earlier transport within this window may be preferred if high quality CPR can be maintained during transport and for those with initial non-shockable rhythms.},

	abstract = {Background
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using extracorporeal life support (ECLS) system has been successfully used to support patients with in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA, OHCA) when conventional measures have failed. The purpose of the current study is to report on our experience with extracorporeal CPR in non-postcardiotomy patients.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed a total of 85 consecutive adult patients, who have been treated with ECLS between January 2007 and January 2012.
Results
The mean CPR duration was 40min (20–70min). The mean ECLS support duration was 49h (12–92h). Twenty-eight patients (33\%) had ECLS related complications. Forty patients (47\%) were successfully weaned and 29 patients (34\%) survived to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 93\% were without severe neurologic deficit. Duration of CPR was shorter for survivors than for non-survivors [(25: 20–50min) vs. (50: 25–86min); p=0.003]. Immediately after ECLS start, the mean blood lactate level was lower (p=0.003), and the mean pH value was higher in the survivors’ group (p{\textless}0.0001) compared to the non-survivors’ group. The CPR duration for the IHCA group (25: 20–50min) was shorter compared to the OHCA group (70: 55–110min; p{\textless}0.0001). The survival rate in this group was higher compared to the OHCA group (42\% vs. 15\%; p{\textless}0.02).
Conclusions
CPR using modern miniaturized ECLS systems should be established in the treatment of prolonged cardiac arrest and unsuccessful conventional CPR in selected patients. CPR with ECLS for OHCA has worse outcomes compared to IHCA. Duration of CPR was independent risk factor for mortality after extracorporeal CPR.},

	abstract = {Background
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been shown to improve survival in children and adults. We describe outcomes after the use of ECMO to support CPR (E-CPR) in adults using multiinstitutional data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry.
Methods
Patients greater than 18 years of age using ECMO to support CPR (E-CPR) during 1992 to 2007 were extracted from the ELSO registry and analyzed.
Results
Two hundred and ninety-seven (11\% of 2,633 adult ECMO uses) reports of E-CPR use in 295 patients were analyzed. Median age was 52 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35, 64) and most patients had cardiac disease (n = 221; 75\%). Survival to hospital discharge was 27\%. Brain death occurred in 61 (28\%) of nonsurvivors. In a multivariate logistic regression model, pre-ECMO factors including a diagnosis of acute myocarditis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.18; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.69) compared with noncardiac diagnoses and use of percutaneous cannulation technique (OR: 0.42; 95\% CI: 0.21 to 0.87) lowered odds of mortality, whereas a lower pre-ECMO arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) less than 70 mm Hg (OR: 2.7; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 6.07) compared with a Pao2of 149 mm Hg or greater increased odds of mortality. The need for renal replacement therapy during ECMO increased odds of mortality (OR: 2.41; 95\% CI: 1.34 to 4.34).
Conclusions
The use of E-CPR was associated with survival in 27\% of adults with cardiac arrest facing imminent mortality. Further studies are warranted to evaluate and better define patients who may benefit from E-CPR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is poor and gets worse after prolonged resuscitation. Recently introduced attempts like an early installed emergency extracorporeal life support (E-ECLS) in patients with persisting cardiac arrest at the emergency department (ED) are tried. The "Vienna Cardiac Arrest Registry" (VICAR) was introduced August 2013 to collect Utstein-style data. The aim of this observational study was to identify the incidence of patients which fulfil "load\&go"-criteria for E-ECLS at the ED.
METHODS: VICAR was retrospectively analyzed for following criteria: age {\textless}75 years; witnessed OHCA; basic life support; ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia; no return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC) within 15 min of advanced-life-support, which were supposed as potential optimal criteria for "load\&go" plus successful E-ECLS treatment at the ED. The observation period was from August 1, 2013 to July 31, 2014.
RESULTS: Over 948 OHCA patients registered during the study period; data were exploitable for 864 patients. Of all patients, "load\&go"-criteria were fulfilled by 55 (6\%). However, 96 (11\%) were transported with on-going CPR to the ED. Of these 96 patients, only 16 (17\%) met the "load\&go"-criteria. Similarly, among the 96 patients, 12 adults were treated with E-ECLS at the ED, with only 5 meeting the criteria. Among these 12 patients, favourable neurological outcome (CPC 1/2) was obtained in 1 patient without criteria.
CONCLUSION: Further promotion of these criteria within the ambulance crews is needed. May be these criteria could serve as a decision support for emergency physicians/paramedics, which patients to transport with on-going CPR to the ED for E-ECLS.},

We sought to identify patients who fulfilled a set of ECPR criteria in order to estimate: (1) the proportion of patients with refractory cardiac arrest who may have benefited from ECPR; and (2) the outcomes achieved with conventional resuscitation.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis from a 52-month prospective registry of consecutive adult non-traumatic OHCA cases from a single urban Canadian health region serving one million patients. We developed a hypothetical ECPR-eligible cohort including adult patients {\textless}60 years of age with a witnessed OHCA, and either bystander CPR or EMS arrival within five minutes. The primary outcome was the proportion of ECPR-eligible patients who had refractory cardiac arrest, defined as termination of resuscitation pre-hospital or in the ED. The secondary outcome was the proportion of EPCR-eligible patients who survived to hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Of 1,644 EMS-treated OHCA, 168 (10.2\%) fulfilled our ECPR criteria. Overall, 54/1644 (3.3\%; 95\% CI 2.4\%-4.1\%) who were ECPR-eligible had refractory cardiac arrest. Of ECPR-eligible patients, 114/168 (68\%, 95\% CI 61\%-75\%) survived to hospital admission, and 70/168 (42\%; 95\% CI 34-49\%) survived to hospital discharge.
CONCLUSION: In our region, approximately 10\% of EMS-treated cases of OHCA fulfilled our ECPR criteria, and approximately one-third of these (an average of 12 patients per year) were refractory to conventional resuscitation. The integration of an ECPR program into an existing high-performing system of care may have a small but clinically important effect on patient outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: To track the ED revisit risk over time using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a major latent class model. Given the HMM states, we carried out forecasting of future ED revisits with various data mining models.
METHODS: Information integrated from four distributed sources (e.g. electronic health records and health information exchange) was integrated into four HMMs which capture the relationships between an observed and a hidden progression that shift over time through a series of hidden states in an adult patient population.
RESULTS: Assimilating a pre-analysis of the various patients by applying latent class models and directing them to well-known classifiers functioned well. The performance was significantly better than without utilizing pre-analysis of HMM for all prediction models (classifiers(.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that one prospective approach to advanced risk prediction is to leverage the longitudinal nature of health care data by exploiting patients' between state variation.},

	abstract = {Objective: Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that reverses life-threatening effects of opioid overdose. Since the 1970s, naloxone products have been developed as injectable solutions, and more recently as nasal sprays. Naloxone products have saved many lives in emergency settings. These products are routinely carried by public safety first-responders including fire fighters (FF), law enforcement officers (LEO), and emergency medical services (EMS). Now, they are also distributed through community access programs to the public. While public safety medications are monitored, those publically distributed are not, so expired products can be possibly found on-hand in an emergency. This study analyzed the quality and stability of expired Naloxone HCl Solutions for Injection, to assess their remaining efficacies and potential risks. Methods: The samples were collected from EMS or law enforcement training supplies and expired returns, with expiration dates ranging from 1990 to 2018. Using standardized techniques, the remaining naloxone was quantified, and the main degradation products, nornaloxone (also known as noroxymorphone) and other possible species, were monitored and quantified systematically. Results: Most tested samples were found containing more than 90\% of labeled naloxone, including those stored for nearly 30 years. The naloxone degradation was slow, but generally correlated with storage time length. There was no significant amount of degradation products detected across all samples. Nornaloxone was detected from some older samples, but all less than 1\%. Therefore, although it is an opioid agonist, the risk caused by nornaloxone should be low. Conclusion: This quality assessment demonstrates that expired naloxone products may still meet USP standards, even after many years. Further pharmaceutical, clinical, and regulatory investigation should be conducted to confirm our findings, especially for new naloxone products with different formulations and routes of administration. Extending the shelf-life of naloxone products may have important financial and public health consequences in addressing future drug shortages and meeting the needs for this critical drug.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify the optimal target of a future intervention to improve physician decision making in trauma triage.
STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) of current practice with hypothetical interventions targeting either physicians' decisional thresholds (attitudes toward transferring patients to trauma centers) or perceptual sensitivity (ability to identify patients who meet transfer guidelines).
METHODS: Taking the societal perspective, we constructed a Markov decision model, drawing estimates of triage patterns, mortality, utilities, and costs from the literature. We assumed that an intervention to change the decisional threshold would reduce undertriage but also increase overtriage more than an intervention to change perceptual sensitivity. We performed a series of 1-way sensitivity analyses and studied the most influential variables in a Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: The ICER of an intervention to change perceptual sensitivity was \$62,799 per qualityadjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with current practice. The ICER of an intervention to change the decisional threshold was \$104,975/ QALY gained compared with an intervention to change perceptual sensitivity. These findings were most sensitive to the relative cost of hospitalizing patients with moderate to severe injuries and their relative risk of dying at non-trauma centers. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100,000/QALY gained, there was a 62\% likelihood that an intervention to change perceptual sensitivity was the most cost-effective alternative.
CONCLUSIONS: Even a minor investment in changing decision making in trauma triage could greatly improve quality of care. The optimal intervention depends on the characteristics of the individual trauma systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A favorable neurological outcome is likely to be achieved in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG). However, in patients without pre-hospital restoration of spontaneous circulation despite the initial VF/VT, the outcome is extremely low by conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) may enhance cerebral blood flow and recovery of neurological function. We prospectively examined how ECPR for OHCA with VF/VT would affect neurological outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The design of this trial was a prospective, observational study. We compared differences of outcome at 1 and 6 months after OHCA between ECPR group (26 hospitals) and non-ECPR group (20 hospitals). Primary endpoints were the rate of favorable outcomes defined by the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance and Overall Performance Categories (CPC) 1 or 2 at 1 and 6 months after OHCA. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, CPC 1 or 2 were 12.3\% (32/260) in the ECPR group and 1.5\% (3/194) in the non-ECPR group at 1 month (P{\textless}0.0001), and 11.2\% (29/260) and 2.6\% (5/194) at 6 months (P=0.001), respectively. By per protocol analysis, CPC 1 or 2 were 13.7\% (32/234) in the ECPR group and 1.9\% (3/159) in the non-ECPR group at 1 month (P{\textless}0.0001), and 12.4\% (29/234) and 3.1\% (5/159) at 6 months (P=0.002), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In OHCA patients with VF/VT on the initial ECG, a treatment bundle including ECPR, therapeutic hypothermia and IABP was associated with improved neurological outcome at 1 and 6 months after OHCA.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many patients who suffer cardiac arrest do not respond to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation. There is growing interest in utilizing veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) in the management of refractory cardiac arrest. We describe our preliminary experiences in establishing an E-CPR program for refractory cardiac arrest in Melbourne, Australia.

METHODS: The CHEER trial (mechanical CPR, Hypothermia, ECMO and Early Reperfusion) is a single centre, prospective, observational study conducted at The Alfred Hospital. The CHEER protocol was developed for selected patients with refractory in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and involves mechanical CPR, rapid intravenous administration of 30mL/kg of ice-cold saline to induce intra-arrest therapeutic hypothermia, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral artery and vein by two critical care physicians and commencement of veno-arterial ECMO. Subsequently, patients with suspected coronary artery occlusion are transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary angiography. Therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) is maintained for 24hours in the intensive care unit.

RESULTS: There were 26 patients eligible for the CHEER protocol (11 with OHCA, 15 with IHCA). The median age was 52 (IQR 38-60) years. ECMO was established in 24 (92\%), with a median time from collapse until initiation of ECMO of 56 (IQR 40-85) minutes. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on 11 (42\%) and pulmonary embolectomy on one patient. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 25 (96\%) patients. Median duration of ECMO support was 2 (IQR 1-5) days, with 13/24 (54\%) of patients successfully weaned from ECMO support. Survival to hospital discharge with full neurological recovery (CPC score 1) occurred in 14/26 (54\%) patients.

CONCLUSIONS: A protocol including E-CPR instituted by critical care physicians for refractory cardiac arrest which includes mechanical CPR, peri-arrest therapeutic hypothermia and ECMO is feasible and associated with a relatively high survival rate.},

We report the outcomes of the initial 3-month period of operations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three emergency medical services systems serving the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area participated in the protocol. Inclusion criteria included age 18 to 75 years, body habitus accommodating automated Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and estimated transfer time from the scene to the cardiac catheterization laboratory of ≤30 minutes. Exclusion criteria included known terminal illness, Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate status, traumatic arrest, and significant bleeding. Refractory VF/VT arrest was defined as failure to achieve sustained return of spontaneous circulation after treatment with 3 direct current shocks and administration of 300 mg of intravenous/intraosseous amiodarone. Patients were transported to the University of Minnesota, where emergent advanced perfusion strategies (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ECMO), followed by coronary angiography and primary coronary intervention (PCI), were performed, when appropriate. Over the first 3 months of the protocol, 27 patients were transported with ongoing mechanical CPR. Of these, 18 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. ECMO was placed in 83\%. Seventy-eight percent of patients had significant coronary artery disease with a high degree of complexity and 67\% received PCI. Seventy-eight percent of patients survived to hospital admission and 55\% (10 of 18) survived to hospital discharge, with 50\% (9 of 18) achieving good neurological function (cerebral performance categories 1 and 2). No significant ECMO-related complications were encountered.
CONCLUSIONS: The MRC refractory VF/VT protocol is feasible and led to a high functionally favorable survival rate with few complications.},

In the full cohort, the advanced airway group incurred a lower rate of favorable neurological outcome compared with the bag-valve-mask group (1.1\% vs 2.9\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.39). In multivariable logistic regression, advanced airway management had an OR for favorable neurological outcome of 0.38 (95\% CI, 0.37-0.40) after adjusting for age, sex, etiology of arrest, first documented rhythm, witnessed status, type of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of public access automated external defibrillator, epinephrine administration, and time intervals. Similarly, the odds of neurologically favorable survival were significantly lower both for endotracheal intubation (adjusted OR, 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.45) and for supraglottic airways (adjusted OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.40). In a propensity score–matched cohort (357 228 patients), the adjusted odds of neurologically favorable survival were significantly lower both for endotracheal intubation (adjusted OR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.55) and for use of supraglottic airways (adjusted OR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.33-0.39). Both endotracheal intubation and use of supraglottic airways were similarly associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival.Among adult patients with OHCA, any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In mechanically ventilated patients, awareness with paralysis (AWP) can have devastating consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and thoughts of suicide. Single-center data from the emergency department (ED) demonstrate an event rate for AWP factors higher than that reported from the operating room. However, there remains a lack of data on AWP among critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. The objective was to assess the proportion of ED patients experiencing AWP and investigate modifiable variables associated with its occurrence. DESIGN: An a priori planned secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective, before-and-after clinical trial. SETTING: The ED of three academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated adult patients that received neuromuscular blockers. INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All data related to sedation and analgesia were collected. AWP was the primary outcome, assessed with the modified Brice questionnaire, and was independently adjudicated by three expert reviewers. Perceived threat, in the causal pathway for PTSD, was the secondary outcome. A total of 388 patients were studied. The proportion of patients experiencing AWP was 3.4\% (n = 13), the majority of whom received rocuronium (n = 12/13; 92.3\%). Among patients who received rocuronium, 5.5\% (n = 12/230) experienced AWP, compared with 0.6\% (n = 1/158) among patients who did not receive rocuronium in the ED (odds ratio, 8.64; 95\% CI, 1.11–67.15). Patients experiencing AWP had a higher mean (sd) threat perception scale score, compared with patients without AWP (15.6 [5.8] vs 7.7 [6.0]; p {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: AWP was present in a concerning proportion of mechanically ventilated ED patients, was associated with rocuronium exposure in the ED, and led to increased levels of perceived threat, placing patients at greater risk for PTSD. Studies that aim to further quantify AWP in this vulnerable population and eliminate its occurrence are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, convenience sample of awake and alert adult patients who required emergency intubation between January 2014 and February 2016 in the ED at our Level II Trauma facility. All patients intubated in the ED were screened for enrollment. Patients presenting in cardiac arrest, status epilepticus, or coma were excluded along with those who died prior to extubation or had poor neurologic status post-extubation. Patients who met study criteria were consented after medical recovery and asked to rate their anxiety, distress, pain, and awareness of the procedure on a 5-point Likert scale. The survey was designed de novo as there was no prior validated instrument. Reliability was assessed by measuring similarity in two sets of responses to the same question. Internal consistency was measured to show trends in responses. Subgroup analysis consisted of comparing the amount of drug administered per kg bodyweight between those with and without adequate sedation based on a t-test (0.05 threshold for signiﬁcance). Rates are presented with 95\% conﬁdence intervals (Æ). The hospital IRB approved the study.
Results: Of 275 patients who were screened for enrollment, 53 met inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Most were female (55\%) age 59 Æ 17.5 years with a mean bodyweight of 83.4 Æ 29.3 kg. Nearly all received etomidate for sedation (98\%, 52/53). Most (87\%, 46/53) received succinylcholine as their paralytic agent, with the remainder receiving rocuronium (6) or vecuronium (1). Regarding distress during RSI, most indicated minimal or tolerable levels (40/ 53, 75 Æ 11.7\%). The majority rated pain as none or minimal (36/53, 68 Æ 12.5\%) and anxiety as either calm or restless (26/53, 54 Æ 13.4\%). Concerning awareness, the majority described themselves as unaware or very sleepy (37/53, 70 Æ 12.3\%). However, 45 Æ 13.4\% (24/35) reported some level of awareness. Analysis of survey reliability produced an unweighted kappa of 0.762 and a weighted kappa of 0.860. Internal consistency was acceptable with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.674. Mean doses of drug per kg bodyweight for acceptable and unacceptable sedation were 0.27 Æ 0.095 mg and 0.27 Æ 0.046 mg respectively (p¼0.864).
Conclusions: Quality of emergency department RSI should not only be judged by objective outcomes, but also by patient perception. While most patients had a tolerable experience (distress level 3 of 5), about a fourth did not. As well, almost half reported some level of awareness through their RSI experience. RSI-associated pain was rated as painful (score of !4) by about 25\% of respondents. Further research is required to determine how to optimize RSI from the patient perspective. This study was limited by patient recall following critical illness as well as potential for confusion between the entirety of their intubated course and their initial RSI intubation experience.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We planned a survey to evaluate the current incidence and risk factors of intraoperative awareness.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted via the Internet. The survey was designed to obtain information regarding cases involving intraoperative awareness in 2008.
RESULTS: A total of 172 anesthesiologists answered the survey. The total number of reported anesthetic cases was 85,156. Twenty-four cases of definite or possible awareness were reported by 21 anesthesiologists, of which 14 were cases of definite awareness and ten of possible awareness. The incidence of awareness, including possible awareness, was 0.028\%. Propofol was used in 21 cases, sevoflurane in two, and a high dose of fentanyl in one. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was used in seven cases (29\%). Sixteen patients (67\%) were {\textless}50 years old, six (26\%) were men, and 17 (74\%) were women. As the type of surgery, three cases (13\%) involved gynecological surgeries and seven (30\%) involved cervicofacial surgeries. During surgery, the memory at postural change was preserved in two cases.
CONCLUSION: The most surprising finding of this study is that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was used in 21 of the 24 (88\%) cases of definite and possible awareness. Although the incidence of intraoperative awareness was compatible with the previous studies, meticulous care should be taken when anesthesia is performed by TIVA for high-risk patients. The results of this survey should be verified, as well as further continuous survey and prospective study, because this study was performed by an anonymous questionnaire survey conducted over only 1-year period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have prospectively evaluated the incidence and characteristics of awareness with recall (AWR) during general anaesthesia in a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: This study involves a prospective observational investigation of AWR in patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Blinded structured interviews were conducted in the postanaesthesia care unit, on postoperative day 7 and day 30. Definition of AWR was 'when the patient stated or remembered that he or she had been awake at a time when consciousness was not intended'. Patient characteristics, perioperative, and drug-related factors were investigated. Patients were classified as not awake during surgery, AWR, AWR-possible, AWR-not evaluable. The perceived quality of the awareness episode, intraoperative dreaming, and sequelae were investigated. The anaesthetic records were reviewed to search for data that might explain the awareness episode.
RESULTS: The study included 4001 patients. Incidence of AWR was 1.0\% (39/3921 patients). If high risk for AWR patients were excluded, the incidence was 0.8\%. After the interview on the seventh day, six patients denied having been conscious during anaesthesia; hence, the incidence of AWR in elective surgery was 0.6\%. Factors associated with AWR were: anaesthetic technique incidence of 1.1\% TIVA-propofol vs 0.59\% balanced anaesthesia vs 5.0\% O2/N2O-based anaesthesia vs 0.9\% other anaesthetic techniques (mainly propofol boluses for short procedures), P=0.008; age (AWR 42.3 yr old vs 50.6 yr old, P=0.041), absence of i.v. benzodiazepine premedication (P=0.001), Caesarean section (C-section) (P=0.019), and surgery performed at night (P=0.013). More than 50\% of patients reported intraoperative dreaming in the early interview, mainly pleasant. Avoidable human factors were detected from the anaesthetic records of most patients. Subjective auditory perceptions prevailed, together with trying to move or communicate, and touch or pain perception.
CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high incidence of AWR and dreams during general anaesthesia was found. Techniques without halogenated drugs showed more patients. The use of benzodiazepine premedication was associated with a lower incidence of AWR. Age, C-section with general anaesthesia, and surgery performed at night are risk factors.},

There are no recent data on the incidence of this complication in the United States. We, therefore, undertook a prospective study to determine the incidence of awareness with recall during general anesthesia in the United States. This is a prospective, nonrandomized descriptive cohort study that was conducted at seven academic medical centers in the United States. Patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were interviewed in the postoperative recovery room and at least a week after anesthesia and surgery by using a structured interview. Data from 19,575 patients are presented. A total of 25 awareness cases were identified (0.13\% incidence). These occurred at a rate of 1-2 cases per 1000 patients at each site. Awareness was associated with increased ASA physical status (odds ratio, 2.41; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-5.60 for ASA status III-V compared with ASA status I-II). Age and sex did not influence the incidence of awareness. There were 46 additional cases (0.24\%) of possible awareness and 1183 cases (6.04\%) of possible intraoperative dreaming. The incidence of awareness during general anesthesia with recall in the United States is comparable to that described in other countries. Assuming that approximately 20 million anesthetics are administered in the United States annually, we can expect approximately 26,000 cases to occur each year.},

	abstract = {We present the main findings of the 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) on accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA). Incidences were estimated using reports of accidental awareness as the numerator, and a parallel national anaesthetic activity survey to provide denominator data. The incidence of certain/probable and possible accidental awareness cases was {\textasciitilde}1:19,600 anaesthetics (95\% confidence interval 1:16,700-23,450). However, there was considerable variation across subtypes of techniques or subspecialities. The incidence with neuromuscular block (NMB) was {\textasciitilde}1:8200 (1:7030-9700), and without, it was {\textasciitilde}1:135,900 (1:78,600-299,000). The cases of AAGA reported to NAP5 were overwhelmingly cases of unintended awareness during NMB. The incidence of accidental awareness during Caesarean section was {\textasciitilde}1:670 (1:380-1300). Two-thirds (82, 66\%) of cases of accidental awareness experiences arose in the dynamic phases of anaesthesia, namely induction of and emergence from anaesthesia. During induction of anaesthesia, contributory factors included: use of thiopental, rapid sequence induction, obesity, difficult airway management, NMB, and interruptions of anaesthetic delivery during movement from anaesthetic room to theatre. During emergence from anaesthesia, residual paralysis was perceived by patients as accidental awareness, and commonly related to a failure to ensure full return of motor capacity. One-third (43, 33\%) of accidental awareness events arose during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia, mostly due to problems at induction or towards the end of anaesthesia. Factors increasing the risk of accidental awareness included: female sex, age (younger adults, but not children), obesity, anaesthetist seniority (junior trainees), previous awareness, out-of-hours operating, emergencies, type of surgery (obstetric, cardiac, thoracic), and use of NMB. The following factors were not risk factors for accidental awareness: ASA physical status, race, and use or omission of nitrous oxide. We recommend that an anaesthetic checklist, to be an integral part of the World Health Organization Safer Surgery checklist, is introduced as an aid to preventing accidental awareness.

	abstract = {The 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland into accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA) yielded data related to psychological aspects from the patient, and the anaesthetist, perspectives; patients' experiences ranged from isolated auditory or tactile sensations to complete awareness. A striking finding was that 75\% of experiences were for {\textless}5 min, yet 51\% of patients [95\% confidence interval (CI) 43-60\%] experienced distress and 41\% (95\% CI 33-50\%) suffered longer term adverse effect. Distress and longer term harm occurred across the full range of experiences but were particularly likely when the patient experienced paralysis (with or without pain). The patient's interpretation of what is happening at the time of the awareness seemed central to later impact; explanation and reassurance during suspected AAGA or at the time of report seemed beneficial. Quality of care before the event was judged good in 26\%, poor in 39\%, and mixed in 31\%. Three-quarters of cases of AAGA (75\%) were judged preventable. In 12\%, AAGA care was judged good and the episode not preventable. The contributory and human factors in the genesis of the majority of cases of AAGA included medication, patient, and education/training. The findings have implications for national guidance, institutional organization, and individual practice. The incidence of 'accidental awareness' during sedation ({\textasciitilde}1:15,000) was similar to that during general anaesthesia ({\textasciitilde}1:19,000). The project raises significant issues about information giving and consent for both sedation and anaesthesia. We propose a novel approach to describing sedation from the patient's perspective which could be used in communication and consent. Eight (6\%) of the patients had resorted to legal action (12, 11\%, to formal complaint) at the time of reporting. NAP5 methodology provides a standardized template that might usefully inform the investigation of claims or serious incidents related to AAGA.},

	abstract = {Study objective
Ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes are subtle and transient in patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-acute coronary syndrome. However, the out-of-hospital ECG is not routinely used during subsequent evaluation at the emergency department. Therefore, we sought to compare the diagnostic performance of out-of-hospital and ED ECG and evaluate the incremental gain of artificial intelligence-augmented ECG analysis.
Methods
This prospective observational cohort study recruited patients with out-of-hospital chest pain. We retrieved out-of-hospital-ECG obtained by paramedics in the field and the first ED ECG obtained by nurses during inhospital evaluation. Two independent and blinded reviewers interpreted ECG dyads in mixed order per practice recommendations. Using 179 morphological ECG features, we trained, cross-validated, and tested a random forest classifier to augment non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) diagnosis.
Results
Our sample included 2,122 patients (age 59 [16]; 53\% women; 44\% Black, 13.5\% confirmed acute coronary syndrome). The rate of diagnostic ST elevation and ST depression were 5.9\% and 16.2\% on out-of-hospital-ECG and 6.1\% and 12.4\% on ED ECG, with ∼40\% of changes seen on out-of-hospital-ECG persisting and ∼60\% resolving. Using expert interpretation of out-of-hospital-ECG alone gave poor baseline performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, and negative predictive values of 0.69, 0.50, and 0.92. Using expert interpretation of serial ECG changes enhanced this performance (AUC 0.80, sensitivity 0.61, and specificity 0.93). Interestingly, augmenting the out-of-hospital-ECG alone with artificial intelligence algorithms boosted its performance (AUC 0.83, sensitivity 0.75, and specificity 0.95), yielding a net reclassification improvement of 29.5\% against expert ECG interpretation.
Conclusion
In this study, 60\% of diagnostic ST changes resolved prior to hospital arrival, making the ED ECG suboptimal for the inhospital evaluation of NSTE-ACS. Using serial ECG changes or incorporating artificial intelligence-augmented analyses would allow correctly reclassifying one in 4 patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.},

Using 554 temporal-spatial features of the 12-lead ECG, we train and test multiple classifiers on two independent prospective patient cohorts (n = 1244). While maintaining higher negative predictive value, our final fusion model achieves 52\% gain in sensitivity compared to commercial interpretation software and 37\% gain in sensitivity compared to experienced clinicians.

Consensus was achieved when items reached a high level of agreement, defined as greater than 80\% responses for a particular item rated a 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale.
Results: Snowball sampling generated a panel of 14 content experts, composed of physicians from four continents and five primary specialties. Seven existing institutional protocols for ECPR cannulation following OHCA were identified and merged into a single comprehensive list of 207 items. The panel reached consensus on 101 items meeting final criteria for inclusion: Prior to Patient Arrival (13 items), Inclusion Criteria (8), Exclusion Criteria (7), Patient Arrival (8), ECPR Cannulation (21), Go On Pump (18), and Post-Cannulation (26).

Methods and Results:  Relevant literature published up to July 2020 was identified using PubMed. All human studies of prehospital adult patients suspected of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in which prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation by paramedics or computers was evaluated and reporting all 4 (true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative) values were included. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for the diagnostic accuracy of prehospital ECG interpretation by paramedics (Clinical Question [CQ] 1) and computers (CQ2). After screening, 4 studies for CQ1 and 6 studies for CQ2 were finally included in the meta-analysis. Regarding CQ1, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 82.5–99.0\%) and 95.8\% (95\% CI 82.3–99.1\%), respectively. Regarding CQ2, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 85.4\% (95\% CI 74.1–92.3\%) and 95.4\% (95\% CI 87.3–98.4\%), respectively.
Conclusions:  This meta-analysis suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of paramedic prehospital ECG interpretations is favorable, with high pooled sensitivity and specificity, with an acceptable estimated number of false positives and false negatives. Computerassisted ECG interpretation showed high pooled specificity with an acceptable estimated number of false positives, whereas the pooled sensitivity was relatively low.},

	abstract = {Background
There is limited literature exploring the relationship between simulation training and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) outcomes. We examined whether there was an association between the implementation of an in situ simulation training program and ECPR utilisation, time to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and neurologically intact survival.

Methods
In this retrospective pre-post study of in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA), we analysed data for all patients recorded as receiving ECPR from September 2009 to December 2020 at our institution, relative to the implementation of an in situ ECPR simulation training program and a standardised procedure for high-quality ECPR. The primary outcome was Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2 at hospital discharge.

Results
There were 27 patients in the pre-intervention period and 39 patients in the post-intervention period. The median ECPR rate per year was 2 pre-intervention and 7 post-intervention (p = 0.073). There was an association between the implementation of the program and decreased median time from OHCA to ECMO flow, from 87 (IQR 78–95) minutes pre-intervention to 70 (IQR 69–72) minutes post-intervention (p = 0.002). Median time from IHCA to ECMO flow was 40 (IQR 20–75) minutes pre-intervention and 28 (IQR 16–41) minutes post-intervention (p = 0.134). Survival with CPC 1 or 2 was 7/27 (25.9\%) pre-intervention and 15/39 (38.5\%) post-intervention (p = 0.288).

Conclusion
We observed an association between the implementation of an ECPR-specific simulation program and decreased time from OHCA to ECMO flow. There was no association between the implementation of the program and neurologically intact survival at hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {Background
The prevalence of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been increasing rapidly worldwide. However, guidelines or clinical studies do not provide sufficient data on ECPR practice. The aim of this study was to provide real-world data on ECPR for patients with OHCA, including details of complications.

Methods
We did a retrospective database analysis of observational multicenter cohort study in Japan. Adult patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology who received ECPR between 2013 and 2018 were included. The primary outcome was favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge, defined as a cerebral performance category of 1 or 2.

Results
A total of 1644 patients with OHCA were included in this study. The patient age was 18–93 years (median: 60 years). Shockable rhythm in the initial cardiac rhythm at the scene was 69.4\%. The median estimated low flow time was 55 min (interquartile range: 45–66 min). Favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was observed in 14.1\% of patients, and the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 27.2\%. The proportions of favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge in terms of shockable rhythm, pulseless electrical activity, and asystole were 16.7\%, 9.2\%, and 3.9\%, respectively. Complications were observed during ECPR in 32.7\% of patients, and the most common complication was bleeding, with the rates of cannulation site bleeding and other types of hemorrhage at 16.4\% and 8.5\%, respectively.

Conclusions
In this large cohort, data on the ECPR of 1644 patients with OHCA show that the proportion of favorable neurological outcomes at hospital discharge was 14.1\%, survival rate at hospital discharge was 27.2\%, and complications were observed during ECPR in 32.7\%.

The aim of this study was to describe the survival and neurological outcome in patients with OHCA treated with and without mechanical circulatory support (MCS).
Methods
This was a retrospective observational cohort study on patients with OHCA admitted to Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, between January 2015 and December 2019. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate 30-day and 30–180-day survival. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between covariates and one-year mortality.
Results
Among 1,015 patients admitted, 698 achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before admission, 101 patients with refractory OHCA received mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and the remaining 216 patients with refractory OHCA did not receive MCS treatment. Survival to hospital discharge was 47\% (478/1015). Good neurological outcome defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1–2 were seen among 92\% (438/478) of the patients discharged from hospital. Median low-flow was 15 [8–22] minutes in the ROSC group and 105 [94–123] minutes in the MCS group. Mortality rates were high within the first 30 days, however; 30–180-day survival in patients discharged remained constant over time in both patients with ROSC on admission and patients admitted with MCS. Advanced age {\textgreater} 70 years (hazard ratio (HR) 1.98, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–3.49), pulseless electrical activity (HR 2.39, 95\% CI 1.25–4.60) and asystole HR 2.70, 95\% CI 1.25–5.95) as initial rhythms were associated with one-year mortality in patients with ROSC.
Conclusions
Short-term survival rates were high among patients with ROSC and patients receiving MCS. Among patients who survived to day 30, landmark analyses showed comparable 180-day survival in the two groups despite long low-flow times in the MCS group. Advanced age and initial non-shockable rhythms were independent predictors of one-year mortality in patients with ROSC on admission.},

	abstract = {Background
We aimed to identify the association of pH value in blood gas assessment with neurological outcome among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated by extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).

Methods
We retrospectively analyzed the database of a multicenter prospective observational study on OHCA patients in Osaka prefecture, Japan (CRITICAL study), from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016. We included adult OHCA patients treated by ECPR. Patients with OHCA from external causes such as trauma were excluded. We conducted logistic regression analysis to identify the odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of the pH value for 1 month favorable neurological outcome adjusted for potential confounders including sex, age, witnessed by bystander, CPR by bystander, pre-hospital initial cardiac rhythm, and cardiac rhythm on hospital arrival.

Results
Among the 9822 patients in the database, 260 patients were finally included in the analysis. The three groups were Tertile 1: pH ≥ 7.030, Tertile 2: pH 6.875–7.029, and Tertile 3: pH {\textless} 6.875. The adjusted OR of Tertiles 2 and 3 compared with Tertile 1 for 1 month favorable neurological outcome were 0.26 (95\% CI 0.10–0.63) and 0.24 (95\% CI 0.09–0.61), respectively.

Conclusions
This multi-institutional observational study showed that low pH value ({\textless} 7.03) before the implementation of ECPR was associated with 1 month unfavorable neurological outcome among OHCA patients treated with ECPR. It may be helpful to consider the candidate for ECPR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Occlusion myocardial infarctions (OMIs) of the posterolateral walls are commonly missed by ST-­segment–­ elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria, with {\textgreater}50\% of patients with circumflex occlusion not receiving emergent reperfusion and experiencing increased mortality. ST-­segment depression maximal in leads V1–­V4 (STDmaxV1–­4) has been suggested as an indicator of posterior OMI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed a high-­risk population with acute coronary syndrome. OMI was defined from prior studies as a culprit lesion with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 0 to 2 flow or TIMI 3 flow plus peak troponin T {\textgreater}1.0 ng/mL or troponin I {\textgreater}10 ng/mL. STEMI was defined by the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. ECGs were interpreted blinded to outcomes. Among 808 patients, there were 265 OMIs, 108 (41\%) meeting STEMI criteria. A total of 118 (15\%) patients had “suspected ischemic” STDmaxV1–­4, of whom 106 (90\%) had an acute culprit lesion, 99 (84\%) had OMI, and 95 (81\%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Suspected ischemic STDmaxV1–­4 had 97\% specificity and 37\% sensitivity for OMI. Of the 99 OMIs detected by STDmaxV1–­4, 34\% had {\textless}1 mm ST-­segment depression, and only 47 (47\%) had accompanying STEMI criteria, of which 17 (36\%) were identified a median 1.00 hour earlier by STDmaxV1–­4 than STEMI criteria. Despite similar infarct size, TIMI flow, and coronary interventions, patients with STEMI(−) OMI and STDmaxV1–­4 were less likely than STEMI(+) patients to undergo catheterization within 90 minutes (46\% versus 68\%; P=0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with high-­risk acute coronary syndrome, the specificity of ischemic STDmaxV1–­4 was 97\% for OMI and 96\% for OMI requiring emergent percutaneous coronary intervention. STEMI criteria missed half of OMIs detected by STDmaxV1–­4. Ischemic STDmaxV1–­V4 in acute coronary syndrome should be considered OMI until proven otherwise.},

	abstract = {Importance: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has poor outcome. Whether intra-arrest transport, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), and immediate invasive assessment and treatment (invasive strategy) is beneficial in this setting remains uncertain.
Objective: To determine whether an early invasive approach in adults with refractory OHCA improves neurologically favorable survival.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Single-center, randomized clinical trial in Prague, Czech Republic, of adults with a witnessed OHCA of presumed cardiac origin without return of spontaneous circulation. A total of 256 participants, of a planned sample size of 285, were enrolled between March 2013 and October 2020. Patients were observed until death or day 180 (last patient follow-up ended on March 30, 2021).
Interventions: In the invasive strategy group (n = 124), mechanical compression was initiated, followed by intra-arrest transport to a cardiac center for ECPR and immediate invasive assessment and treatment. Regular advanced cardiac life support was continued on-site in the standard strategy group (n = 132).
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival with a good neurologic outcome (defined as Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1-2) at 180 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included neurologic recovery at 30 days (defined as CPC 1-2 at any time within the first 30 days) and cardiac recovery at 30 days (defined as no need for pharmacological or mechanical cardiac support for at least 24 hours).
Results: The trial was stopped at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board when prespecified criteria for futility were met. Among 256 patients (median age, 58 years; 44 [17\%] women), 256 (100\%) completed the trial. In the main analysis, 39 patients (31.5\%) in the invasive strategy group and 29 (22.0\%) in the standard strategy group survived to 180 days with good neurologic outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.63 [95\% CI, 0.93 to 2.85]; difference, 9.5\% [95\% CI, -1.3\% to 20.1\%]; P = .09). At 30 days, neurologic recovery had occurred in 38 patients (30.6\%) in the invasive strategy group and in 24 (18.2\%) in the standard strategy group (OR, 1.99 [95\% CI, 1.11 to 3.57]; difference, 12.4\% [95\% CI, 1.9\% to 22.7\%]; P = .02), and cardiac recovery had occurred in 54 (43.5\%) and 45 (34.1\%) patients, respectively (OR, 1.49 [95\% CI, 0.91 to 2.47]; difference, 9.4\% [95\% CI, -2.5\% to 21\%]; P = .12). Bleeding occurred more frequently in the invasive strategy vs standard strategy group (31\% vs 15\%, respectively).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the bundle of early intra-arrest transport, ECPR, and invasive assessment and treatment did not significantly improve survival with neurologically favorable outcome at 180 days compared with standard resuscitation. However, the trial was possibly underpowered to detect a clinically relevant difference.

	abstract = {Background
The objective was to assess predictors for unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) in out-of-hospital (OHCA) and in-hospital (IHCA) cardiac arrest patients treated with Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).
Methods
A post hoc analysis of retrospective data from five European ECPR centers (January 2012–December 2016) was performed. The primary composite endpoint was 3-month UO defined as survival with a cerebral performance category (CPC) of 3–4 or death (CPC 5).
Results
A total of 413 patients treated with ECPR were included (median age was 57 [48–65] years, male gender 78\%): 61\% of patients (n = 250) suffered OHCA. The median time from collapse to ECMO placement was 63 [45–82] minutes. Overall, 81\% patients (n = 333) showed unfavorable UO, which was higher in OHCA patients (90\% vs 66\%), as compared to IHCA. In OHCA, prolonged time from collapse to ECMO initiation (OR 1.02, p {\textless} 0.01) and higher ECMO blood flow (OR 1.99, p = 0.01) were associated with UO while initial shockable rhythm (OR 0.04, p {\textless} 0.01), previous heart disease (OR 0.20, p {\textless} 0.01) and pre-hospital hypothermia (OR 0.08, p {\textless} 0.01) had a protective role. In IHCA, prolonged time from arrest to ECMO implantation (OR 1.02, p = 0.03), high lactate level on admission (OR 1.15, p {\textless} 0.01) and higher body weight (OR 1.03, p {\textless} 0.01) were independently associated with UO.
Conclusions
IHCA and OHCA patients receiving ECPR have different predictors of UO at presentation, suggesting that selection criteria for ECPR should be decided according to the location of CA. After ECMO initiation, ECMO blood flow management and mean arterial pressure targets might also impact neurological recovery.},

	abstract = {Background
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has gained increasing as a promising but resource-intensive intervention for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). There is little data to quantify the impact of this intervention and the patients likely to benefit from its use. We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the survival benefit associated with ECPR for OHCA.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify relevant observational studies and randomized control trials. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess studies' quality. We performed random-effects meta-analysis for the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge and used meta-regressions to assess heterogeneity.
Results
We identified 1287 articles, reviewed the full text of 209 and included 44 in our meta-analysis. Our analysis included 3097 patients with OHCA. Patients' mean age was 52, 79\% were male, and 60\% had primary ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest. We identified a survival-to-discharge rate of 24\%; 18\% survived with favorable neurologic function. 30- and 90-days survival rates were both around 18\%. The majority of included articles were high quality studies.
Conclusions
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a promising but resource-intensive intervention that may increase rates of survival to hospital discharge among patients who experience OHCA.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We evaluated the incidence of change in serial 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic classifications in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital (OH) cardiac arrest (OHCA) comparing OH to emergency department (ED) ECGs.
Methods: This retrospective case series included: 1) adults (≥ 18 years old), 2) resuscitated OHCA, 3) ≥ 1 OH and 1 ED ECG/patient, and 4) emergency medical services (EMS) transport to the study hospital. OH and ED ECGs were classified as: 1) STEMI (ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction), 2) ischemia, and 3) non-ischemic. Two ED physicians and one cardiologist independently classified all ECGs, then generated a consensus opinion classification for each ECG based on American Heart Association’s 2018 Expert Consensus criteria. The most ischemic OH ECG classification was compared with the last ED ECG classification.
Results: From 7/27/12 to 7/18/19, 176 patients were entered with a mean age of 61.2 ± 16.6 years; 102/176 (58\%) were male. Overall, 504 OH and ED 12-lead ECGs were acquired (2.9 ECGs/patient). ECG classification inter-rater reliability kappa score was 0.63 ± 0.02 (substantial agreement). Overall, 86/176 (49\%) changed ECG classification from the OH to ED setting; 69/86 (80\%) of these ECGs changed from more to less ischemic classifications. Of 49 OH STEMI ECG classifications, 33/49 (67\%) changed to a less ischemic (non-STEMI) ED ECG classification.
Conclusions: Change in 12-lead ECG classification from OH to ED setting in patients resuscitated from OHCA was common (49\%). The OH STEMI classification changed to a less ischemic (non-STEMI) ED classification in 67\% of cases.},

	abstract = {Aim
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can treat cardiac arrest refractory to conventional therapies. Our goal was to identify the best protocol for survival with good neurological outcome through the evaluation of current inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, cannulation strategies and additional therapeutic measures.

Methods
A systematic literature search was used to identify eligible publications from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane for articles published from 29 June 2009 until 29 June 2019.

Results
The selection process led to a total of 24 eligible articles, considering 1723 patients in total. A good neurological outcome at hospital discharge was found in 21.3\% of all patients. The most consistent criterion for inclusion was refractory cardiac arrest (RCA), used in 21/25 (84\%) of the protocols. The preferred cannulation method was the percutaneous Seldinger technique (44\%).

Conclusion
ECPR is a feasible option for cardiac arrest and should already be considered in an early stage of CPR. One of the key findings is that time-to-ECPR seems to be correlated with good neurological survival. An important contributing factor is the definition of RCA. Protocols defining RCA as {\textgreater}10 ​min had a mean good neurological survival of 26.7\%. Protocols with a higher cut-off, between 15 and 30 ​min, had a mean good neurological survival of 14.5\%. Another factor contributing to the time-to-ECPR is the preferred access technique. A percutaneous Seldinger technique combined with ultrasonography and fluoroscopic guidance leads to a reduced cannulation time and complication rate. Conclusive research around prehospital cannulation still needs to be conducted.},

	abstract = {Background:  The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiac arrest (ECPR) has increased exponentially. However, reported outcomes vary considerably due to differing study designs and selection criteria. This review assessed the impact of pre-defined selection criteria on ECPR survival.
Methods:  Systematic review applying PRISMA guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews for RCTs and observational studies published from January 2000 to June 2021. Adult patients ({\textgreater} 12 years) receiving ECPR were included. Two investigators reviewed and extracted data on study design, number and type of inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Outcomes included overall and neurologically favourable survival. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed.
Results:  67 studies were included: 14 prospective and 53 retrospective. No RCTs were identified at time of search. The number of inclusion criteria to select ECPR patients (p = 0.292) and study design (p = 0.962) was not associated with higher favourable neurological survival. However, amongst prospective studies, increased number of inclusion criteria was associated with improved outcomes in both OHCA and IHCA cohorts. (β = 0.12, p = 0.026) and arrest to ECMO flow time was predictive of survival. (β = -0.023, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions:  Prospective studies showed number of selection criteria and, in particular, arrest to ECMO time were associated with significant improved survival. Well-designed prospective studies assessing the relative importance of criteria as well as larger efficacy studies are required to ensure appropriate application of what is a costly intervention.},

	abstract = {Background
Early and correct diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is crucial for providing timely reperfusion therapy. Patients with ischemic symptoms presenting with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) are preferably transported directly to a catheterization laboratory (Cath-lab) for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). However, the ECG often contains confounding factors making the STEMI diagnosis challenging leading to false positive Cath-lab activation. The objective of this study was to test the performance of a standard automated algorithm against an additional high specificity setting developed for reducing the false positive STEMI calls.
Methods
We included consecutive patients with an available digital prehospital ECG triaged directly to Cath-lab for acute coronary angiography between 2009 and 2012. An adjudicated discharge diagnosis of STEMI or no myocardial infarction (no-MI) was assigned for each patient. The new automatic algorithm contains a feature to reduce false positive STEMI interpretation. The STEMI performance with the standard setting (STD) and the high specificity setting (HiSpec) was tested against the adjudicated discharge diagnosis in a retrospective manner.
Results
In total, 2256 patients with an available digital prehospital ECG (mean age 63 ± 13 years, male gender 71\%) were included in the analysis. The discharge diagnosis of STEMI was assigned in 1885 (84\%) patients. The STD identified 165 true negative and 1457 true positive (206 false positive and 428 false negative) cases (77.3\%, 44.5\%, 87.6\% and 17.3\% for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, respectively). The HiSpec identified 191 true negative and 1316 true positive (180 false positive and 569 false negative) cases (69.8\%, 51.5\%, 88.0\% and 25.1\% for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, respectively). From STD to HiSpec, false positive cases were reduced by 26 (12,6\%), but false negative results were increased by 33\%.
Conclusions
Implementing an automated ECG algorithm with a high specificity setting was able to reduce the number of false positive STEMI cases. However, the predictive values for both positive and negative STEMI identification were moderate in this highly selected STEMI population. Finally, due the reduced sensitivity/increased false negatives, a negative AMI statement should not be solely based on the automated ECG statement.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is an important tool to triage patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An immediate coronary angiography after ROSC is recommended only in patients with an ECG that is diagnostic of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). To date, the benefit of this approach has not been demonstrated in patients with a post-ROSC ECG that is not diagnostic of STEMI.To assess whether the time from ROSC to ECG acquisition is associated with the diagnostic accuracy of ECG for STEMI.This retrospective, multicenter cohort study (the Post-ROSC Electrocardiogram After Cardiac Arrest study) analyzed consecutive patients older than 18 years who were resuscitated from OHCA between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, and were admitted to 1 of the 3 participating centers in Europe (Pavia, Italy; Lugano, Switzerland; and Vienna, Austria).Only patients who underwent coronary angiography during hospitalization and who acquired a post-ROSC ECG before the angiography were enrolled. Patients with a nonmedical cause of OHCAs were excluded.The primary end point was false-positive ECG findings, defined as the percentage of patients with post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but who did not show obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography that was worthy of percutaneous coronary angioplasty.Of 586 consecutive patients who were admitted to the 3 participating centers, 370 were included in the analysis (287 men [77.6\%]; median age, 62 years [interquartile range, 53-70 years]); 121 (32.7\%) were enrolled in the participating center in Pavia, Italy; 38 (10.3\%) in Lugano, Switzerland; and 211 (57.0\%) in Vienna, Austria. The percentage of false-positive ECG findings in the first tertile of ROSC to ECG time (≤7 minutes) was significantly higher than that in the second (8-33 minutes) and third (\&gt;33 minutes) tertiles: 18.5\% in the first tertile vs 7.2\% in the second (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.87; P = .02) and 5.8\% in the third (OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.47; P \&lt; .001). These differences remained significant when adjusting for sex (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.85; P = .02; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.26; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.47; P \&lt; .001), age (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.34; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.89; P = .03; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.46; P \&lt; .001), number of segments with ST-elevation (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.81; P = .01; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.52; P \&lt; .001), QRS duration (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.87; P = .02; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.48; P \&lt; .001), heart rate (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.93; P = .04; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.55; P \&lt; .001), epinephrine administered (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.98; P = .045; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.48; P \&lt; .001), shockable initial rhythm (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.96; P = .04; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.26; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.46; P \&lt; .001), and 3 or more shocks administered (≤7 minutes: reference; 8-33 minutes: OR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.13-1.00; P = .05; \&gt;33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.48; P \&lt; .001) in bivariable analyses.This study suggests that early ECG acquisition after ROSC in patients with OHCA is associated with a higher percentage of false-positive ECG findings for STEMI. It may be reasonable to delay post-ROSC ECG by at least 8 minutes after ROSC or repeat the acquisition if the first ECG is diagnostic of STEMI and is acquired early after ROSC.},

	abstract = {Background Good outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) depend on a skilled resuscitation team, prompt initiation of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, and organisational structures to support IHCA response. We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival.
Methods We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and support for roles.
Results Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted nurses as leaders—administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs.
Conclusion Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing training for IHCA care. Though not proof of causation, nurses appear to be critical to effective IHCA response, and how to support their role to optimise outcomes warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: It is unclear if survival rates for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) vary across hospitals depending on whether resuscitations are typically led by an attending physician, physician trainee, or a non-physician. We sought to determine the association between resuscitation team leader credentials and IHCA survival.

Methods: A nationwide survey was done in 2018 to elicit information on resuscitation practices across hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry for IHCA. Using responses from the question of “Who typically leads codes at your institution”, we grouped hospitals based on their typical type of resuscitation team leader: attending physician, physician trainee, or non-physician. Responses from the survey were linked to survival outcomes within the registry. We compared risk-adjusted hospital rates of survival to discharge, return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] and favorable neurological survival for 2015-2017 between these 3 hospital groups using multi variable hierarchical regression.

Results: Overall, 193 hospitals had a minimum of 20 IHCAs and completed the study survey, representing a total of 44,477 IHCAs (mean age of 65.0 ± 15.5, 40.8\% were females). Most hospitals had resuscitations led by physicians, with 121 (62.7\%) led by an attending physician, 58 (30.0\%) by a physician-trainee, and 14 (7.3\%) by a non-physician. Risk-standardized rates of survival to discharge were similar across hospitals, regardless of whether resuscitations were typically led by an attending physician, physician trainee, or non-physician (25.6±4.8\%, 25.9±4.7\%, and 25.7±3.6\%, respectively; p = 0.88). Similarly, there were no differences between the 3 groups in risk-adjusted rates of ROSC (71.7±6.3\%, 73±6.3\%, and 73.4±6.4\%; P = 0.30) and favorable neurological survival (21.6±7.1\%, 22.7±6.1\%, and 20.9±6.5\%; P = 0.50; Figure).

Conclusion: Among hospitals in a national registry, IHCA resuscitations were usually led by physicians. However, there was no association between a hospital’s typical resuscitation team leader credentials and IHCA survival outcomes.

	abstract = {Background  Medical team leaders in cardiac arrest teams are routinely subjected to disproportionately high levels of cognitive burden. This simulation-­based study explored whether the introduction of a dedicated ’nursing team leader’ is an effective way of cognitively offloading medical team leaders of cardiac arrest teams. It was hypothesised that reduced cognitive load may allow medical team leaders to focus on high-­level tasks resulting in improved team performance.
Methods  This randomised controlled trial used a series of in situ simulations performed in two Australian emergency departments in 2018–2019. Teams balanced on experience were randomised to either control (traditional roles) or intervention (designated nursing team leader) groups. No crossover between groups occurred with each participant taking part in a single simulation. Debriefing data were collected for thematic analysis and quantitative evaluation of self-­reported cognitive load and task efficiency was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NTLX) and a ’task time checklist’ which was developed for this trial.
Results  Twenty adult cardiac arrest simulations (120 participants) were evaluated. Intervention group medical team leaders had significantly lower NTLX scores (238.4, 95\% CI 192.0 to 284.7) than those in control groups (306.3, 95\% CI 254.9 to 357.6; p=0.02). Intervention group medical team leaders working alongside a designated nursing leader role had significantly lower cognitive loads than their control group counterparts (206.4 vs 270.5, p=0.02). Teams with a designated nurse leader role had improved time to defibrillator application (23.5 s vs 59 s, p=0.004), faster correction of ineffective compressions (7.5 s vs 14 s, p=0.04), improved compression fraction (91.3 vs 89.9, p=0.048), and shorter time to address reversible causes (107.1 s vs 209.5 s, p=0.002).
Conclusion  Dedicated nursing team leadership in simulation based cardiac arrest teams resulted in cognitive offload for medical leaders and improved team performance.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: In many emergency departments advanced life support (ALS) trained nurses do not assume a lead role in advanced resuscitation. This study investigated whether emergency nurses with previous ALS training provided good team leadership in a simulated cardiac arrest situation.
Methods: A prospective study was conducted at five emergency departments and one nurses’ association meeting. All participants went through the same scenario. Details recorded included baseline blood pressure and pulse rate, time in post, time of ALS training, and subjective stress score (1 = hardly stressed; 10 = extremely stressed). Scoring took into account scenario understanding, rhythm recognition, time to defibrillation, appropriateness of interventions, and theoretical knowledge.
Results: Of 57 participants, 20 were ALS trained nurses, 19 were ALS trained emergency senior house officers (SHOs), and 18 were emergency SHOs without formal ALS training. The overall mean score for doctors without ALS training was 69.5\%, compared with 72.3\% for ALS trained doctors and 73.7\% for ALS trained nurses. Nurses found the experience less stressful (subjective stress score 5.78/10) compared with doctors without ALS training (6.5/10). The mean time taken to defibrillate from the appearance of a shockable rhythm on the monitor by the nurses and those SHOs without ALS training was 42 and 40.8 seconds, respectively.
Conclusion: ALS trained nurses performed as well as ALS trained and non ALS trained emergency SHOs in a simulated cardiac arrest situation and had greater awareness of the potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Thus if a senior or middle grade doctor is not available to lead the resuscitation team, it may be appropriate for experienced nursing staff with ALS training to act as ALS team leaders rather than SHOs.},

Critical comparisons of machine learning–based automated analysis against clinically accepted standards of care are lacking.To use readily available 12-lead ECG data to train and apply an explainability technique to a convolutional neural network (CNN) that achieves high performance against clinical standards of care.This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2018. Data were obtained in a commonly available 12-lead ECG format from a single-center tertiary care institution. All patients aged 18 years or older who received ECGs at the University of California, San Francisco, were included, yielding a total of 365 009 patients. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to March 2, 2021.A CNN was trained to predict the presence of 38 diagnostic classes in 5 categories from 12-lead ECG data. A CNN explainability technique called LIME (Linear Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) was used to visualize ECG segments contributing to CNN diagnoses.Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the CNN in the holdout test data set against cardiologist clinical diagnoses. For a second validation, 3 electrophysiologists provided consensus committee diagnoses against which the CNN, cardiologist clinical diagnosis, and MUSE (GE Healthcare) automated analysis performance was compared using the F1 score; AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated for the CNN against the consensus committee.A total of 992 748 ECGs from 365 009 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [17.6] years; 183 600 women [50.3\%]; and 175 277 White patients [48.0\%]) were included in the analysis. In 91 440 test data set ECGs, the CNN demonstrated an AUC of at least 0.960 for 32 of 38 classes (84.2\%). Against the consensus committee diagnoses, the CNN had higher frequency-weighted mean F1 scores than both cardiologists and MUSE in all 5 categories (CNN frequency-weighted F1 score for rhythm, 0.812; conduction, 0.729; chamber diagnosis, 0.598; infarct, 0.674; and other diagnosis, 0.875). For 32 of 38 classes (84.2\%), the CNN had AUCs of at least 0.910 and demonstrated comparable F1 scores and higher sensitivity than cardiologists, except for atrial fibrillation (CNN F1 score, 0.847 vs cardiologist F1 score, 0.881), junctional rhythm (0.526 vs 0.727), premature ventricular complex (0.786 vs 0.800), and Wolff-Parkinson-White (0.800 vs 0.842). Compared with MUSE, the CNN had higher F1 scores for all classes except supraventricular tachycardia (CNN F1 score, 0.696 vs MUSE F1 score, 0.714). The LIME technique highlighted physiologically relevant ECG segments.The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that readily available ECG data can be used to train a CNN algorithm to achieve comparable performance to clinical cardiologists and exceed the performance of MUSE automated analysis for most diagnoses, with some exceptions. The LIME explainability technique applied to CNNs highlights physiologically relevant ECG segments that contribute to the CNN’s diagnoses.},

There were 2 control groups: the "non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio" group consisted of patients who underwent coronary angiography for presumed type I myocardial infarction but did not meet the definition of occlusion myocardial infarction; the "no occlusion myocardial infarction" control group consisted of randomly selected emergency department patients without occlusion myocardial infarction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}There were 59 occlusion myocardial infarction, 90 non-occlusion myocardial infarction-angio, and 102 no occlusion myocardial infarction subjects (mean age, 72.0 years; 168 [66.9\%] men).

Results were grouped into systems delivering a high volume of PHEA per year ({\textgreater}50 PHEAs) and low volume (≤50 PHEAs per annum). Standard and ‘crash’ (immediate) induction checklists were reviewed for length, content and layout.
Results 59 UK physician-led prehospital services were identified of which 43 (74\%) participated. Thirty services (70\%) provide PHEA and perform approximately 1629 PHEAs annually. Ten ‘high volume’ services deliver 84\% of PHEAs per year with PHEA being performed on a median of 11\% of active missions. The most common indication for PHEA was trauma. 25 of the 30 services (83\%) used a PHEA checklist prior to induction of anaesthesia and 24 (80\%) had an SOP for the procedure. 19 (76\%) of the ‘standard’ checklists and 5 (50\%) of the ‘crash’ induction checklists used were analysed. On average, standard checklists contained 169 (range: 52–286) words and 41 (range: 28–70) individual checks. The style and language complexity varied significantly between different checklists.
Conclusion PHEA is now performed commonly in the UK. The use of checklists for PHEA is relatively common among prehospital systems delivering this intervention. Care must be taken to limit checklist length and to use simple, unambiguous language in order to maximise the safety of this high-risk intervention.},

	abstract = {In terms of time and financial cost, the humble checklist is arguably one of the most effective methods of reducing medical error and improving performance under pressure. Checklists help to ensure all steps in a task are completed and they reduce stress prior to undertaking high-risk procedures. They improve teamwork effectiveness and reduce cognitive overload when patent deterioration or equipment failure occurs.

In 2008 WHO introduced the surgical safety checklist: this has become embedded internationally within safe theatre practice. These checklists have led to reductions in surgical errors, complications and death. They have also been associated with cost savings, improved communication within the operating team and improved attitudes and cultures regarding patient safety.1 Many will have read Atul Gawande’s ‘The Checklist Manifesto’ which not only describes the successful development and introduction of preoperative surgical checklists but importantly also describes some of the barriers to the success of implementation.2 Gawande describes how some operating theatre staff perceived them to slow productivity and to suppress individual practice and flexibility, placing higher value on clinical autonomy.

The use of checklists to support patient care in emergency medicine and prehospital care is increasing. The quality and utility of checklists in medicine is however variable. It is essential that checklists are appropriately designed and worded and are thoroughly tested prior to their introduction into clinical settings. A checklist that has too many steps may risk delaying the start of a time-critical …},

	abstract = {AIM: Conduct a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis of the post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) electrocardiogram (ECG) to indicate an acute-appearing coronary lesion and revascularization.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science through February 18, 2020. Two investigators screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias using QUADAS-2. We estimated sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and likelihood ratios (LR) for all reported ECG features to indicate all reported reference standards. Random-effects meta-analysis pooled comparable studies without critical risk of bias. GRADE methodology evaluated the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: Overall, 48 studies reported 94 combinations of ECG features and reference standards with wide variation in their definitions. Most studies had risks of bias from selection for coronary angiography and blinding to the ECG and/or reference standard. Meta-analysis combined 6 studies for STE and acute coronary lesion (Sn 0.70 [95\% CI 0.54-0.82]; Sp 0.85 [95\% CI 0.78-0.90]; LR + 4.7 [95\% CI 3.3-6.7]; LR- 0.4 [95\% CI 0.2-0.6]) and 4 studies for STE and revascularization (Sn 0.53 [95\% CI 0.47-0.58]; Sp 0.86 [95\% CI 0.80-0.91]; LR + 3.9 [95\% CI 2.8-5.5]; LR- 0.5 [95\% CI 0.5-0.6]). Overall certainty of evidence was low with substantial heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on low certainty evidence, STE had good classification for acute coronary lesion and fair classification for revascularization. STE was more specific than sensitive for these outcomes and no single ECG feature excluded them. Uniform definitions and terminology would greatly facilitate the interpretation of subsequent studies.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key tool to triage out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients after achieving a sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). According to current guidelines, an immediate coronary angiography is indicated only when the post-ROSC ECG discloses a ST-elevation myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Moreover, the 12-lead ECG should be recorded as soon as possible after ROSC, although it is reasonable that in the early post-ROSC stages ECG could reflect the ischemia secondary to cardiac arrest besides that of coronary origin possibly causing an overdiagnosis of STEMI (false positive).To assess whether the time from ROSC to ECG acquisition could affect the percentage of false positive ECG for STEMI.We performed a retrospective, international, multicenter study (PEACE Study - NCT04096079). We included all patients over 18 years of age hospitalized after an OHCA due to medical cause at one of the three participating high-volume hospitals of three different European countries between 2015, 1st January and 2018, 31st December. We considered for the present study only patients who underwent coronary angiography and in whom a post-ROSC ECG was available. For the electrocardiographic diagnosis of STEMI the criteria established by the ESC 2017 guidelines were used, while the execution of a percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was evaluated as an angiographic endpoint. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of time to acquisition and the endpoint. We computed odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (OR, 95\% CI).Population consisted of 370 patients (77.6\% male, mean age 61±13 years, median ROSC-ECG time 15 minutes). Post-ROSC ECG was positive for STEMI in 198 patients and in 39 of them (10.5\%) a PTCA was not performed during urgent coronary angiography, representing the false positive (FP) ECG. Dividing the population in three tertiles according to the time from ROSC to ECG (≤7 mins; 8–33 mins; \&gt;33 mins), the percentage of FP-ECG in the first tertile (18.5\%) was statistically significantly higher than in the second (7.2\%, OR 2.9 (95\% CI 1.1–7.5) p=0.025) and third (5.8\%, OR 3.7 (95\% CI 2.2–6.5) p\&lt;0.001) as also shown in the Figure. These differences remained significant when adjusting for sex, age, number of segments involved at ECG (anterior, lateral, posterior, inferior and right), QRS duration \&gt;120 msec, ECG heart rate \&gt;100 bpm and adrenaline administered \&gt;1 mg.Our study offers the first demonstration that the acquisition of the 12-leads ECG too early after ROSC can misleadingly lead to the diagnosis of STEMI. Despite further validation are required, our data suggest that it may be reasonable to delay the acquisition of the ECG at least 8 minutes after ROSC or to repeat the acquisition if the first ECG, resulting diagnostic for STEMI, was performed very early.Figure 1Type of funding source: None},

	abstract = {Objective
In the STEMI paradigm of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), many NSTEMI patients have unrecognized acute coronary occlusion MI (OMI), may not receive emergent reperfusion, and have higher mortality than NSTEMI patients without occlusion. We have proposed a new OMI vs. Non-Occlusion MI (NOMI) paradigm shift. We sought to compare the diagnostic accuracy of OMI ECG findings vs. formal STEMI criteria for the diagnosis of OMI. We hypothesized that blinded interpretation for predefined OMI ECG findings would be more accurate than STEMI criteria for the diagnosis of OMI.
Methods
We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The primary definition of OMI was either 1) acute TIMI 0–2 flow culprit or 2) TIMI 3 flow culprit with peak troponin T ≥1.0 ng/mL or I ≥10.0 ng/mL.
Results
808 patients were included, of whom 49\% had AMI (33\% OMI; 16\% NOMI). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of STEMI criteria vs Interpreter 1 using OMI ECG findings among 808 patients were 41\% vs 86\%, 94\% vs 91\%, and 77\% vs 89\%, and for Interpreter 2 among 250 patients were 36\% vs 80\%, 91\% vs 92\%, and 76\% vs 89\%. STEMI(−) OMI patients had similar infarct size and mortality as STEMI(+) OMI patients, but greater delays to angiography.
Conclusions
Blinded interpretation using predefined OMI ECG findings was superior to STEMI criteria for the ECG diagnosis of Occlusion MI. These data support further investigation into the OMI vs. NOMI paradigm and suggest that STEMI(−) OMI patients could be identified rapidly and noninvasively for emergent reperfusion using more accurate ECG interpretation.},

	abstract = {Background Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is an emerging concept in cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent research has documented a significant improvement in favorable outcomes, notable survival to discharge, and neurologically intact survival. Objectives The present study undertakes a scoping review to summarize the available evidence by assessing the use of ECPR, compared with no ECPR or the standard of care, for adult patients who sustain cardiac arrest in any setting, in studies which record survival and neurologic outcomes. Methods This review followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Four online databases were used to identify papers published from database inception to July 12, 2020. We selected 23 observational studies from Asia, Europe, and North America that used survival to discharge or neurologically intact survival as a primary or secondary endpoint variable in patients with cardiac arrest refractory to standard treatment. Results Twenty-three observational studies were included in the review. Eleven studies were of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7 studies were of in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 5 studies included mixed populations. Ten studies reported long-term favorable neurological outcomes (ie, Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 – 2 at 3 months [n = 3], 6 months [n = 3], and 1 year [n = 4]), of which only 4 had statistical significance at 5\% significance levels. Current knowledge is mostly drawn from single-center observations, with most of the evidence coming from case series and cohort studies, hence is prone to publication bias. No randomized control trials were included. Conclusions This scoping review highlights the need for high-quality studies to increase the level of evidence and reduce knowledge gaps to change the paradigm of care for patients with shock-refractory cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The delayed return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), also known as the Lazarus phenomenon, is a rare event described in several case reports. This study aims to determine the incidence and the time of occurrence of the Lazarus phenomenon after cessation of out-of-hospital CPR.
Methods
This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in the Helsinki Emergency Medical Service in Finland from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2016. All out-of-hospital CPR attempts were carefully monitored for 10min after the cessation of CPR in order to detect delayed ROSC.
Results
Altogether, 2102 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurred during the six-year study period. CPR was attempted in 1376 (65.5\%) cases. In 840 cases (61.0\% of all attempts) CPR attempts were terminated on site. The Lazarus phenomenon occurred five times, with an incidence of 5.95/1000 (95\% CI 2.10–14.30) in field-terminated CPR attempts. Time to delayed ROSC from the cessation of CPR varied from 3 to 8min. Three of the five patients with delayed ROSC died at the scene within 2–15min while two died later in hospital within 1.5 and 26h, respectively.
Conclusions
We observed that the Lazarus phenomenon is a real albeit rare event and can occur a few minutes after the cessation of out-of-hospital CPR. We suggest a 10-min monitoring period before diagnosing death. CPR guidelines should be updated to include information of the Lazarus phenomenon and appropriate monitoring for it.},

	abstract = {Objectives: 
        A fundamental issue in organ donation after circulatory death is the determination of death. There are limited data regarding the incidence and timing of autoresuscitation after asystole. Prevailing guidelines suggest a 2- to 5-min observation after mechanical asystole before the declaration of death. This study tested the hypothesis that a 2-min observation period after asystole is sufficient for the declaration of death in patients being considered for organ donation after circulatory death.
        Design: 
        Single-center observational study using prospectively collected data.
        Setting: 
        University hospital, Level I trauma center.
        Patients: 
        Those patients identified by the organ donation registry that underwent organ donation after circulatory death from 2000 to 2008, during which time the institutional protocol required a 5-min observation period.
        Interventions: 
        None.
        Measurements and Main Results: 
        Documentation of medical history, serial Glasgow Coma Scale scores, time of extubation, and time to asystole, hypotension, pulseless electrical activity, and declaration of death were ascertained. Seventy-three patients were identified. The most common mechanism of injury was traumatic brain injury, and eight patients were aged {\textless}18 yrs. Patients had a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5 on admission and were taken to organ donation after circulatory death an average of 6.6 days after admission. The average time from extubation to death was 22 mins. No patients exhibited autoresuscitation during the 5-min waiting observation period, including the first 2 mins after asystole.
        Conclusions: 
        The absence of autoresuscitation in our series suggests that a 2-min observation period is sufficient for the determination of death after cardiac arrest, including patients younger than 18 yrs. These data may inform practice guidelines.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize the current scope and practices of centers performing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) on the undifferentiated patient with cardiac arrest in the emergency department.
METHODS: We contacted all US centers in January 2016 that had submitted adult eCPR cases to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry and surveyed them, querying for programs that had performed eCPR in the Emergency Department (ED ECMO). Our objective was to characterize the following domains of ED ECMO practice: program characteristics, patient selection, devices and techniques, and personnel.
RESULTS: Among 99 centers queried, 70 responded. Among these, 36 centers performed ED ECMO. Nearly 93\% of programs are based at academic/teaching hospitals. 65\% of programs are less than 5 years old, and 60\% of programs perform ≤3 cases per year. Most programs (90\%) had inpatient eCPR or salvage ECMO programs prior to starting ED ECMO programs. The majority of programs do not have formal inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most programs preferentially obtain vascular access via the percutaneous route (70\%) and many (40\%) use mechanical CPR during cannulation. The most commonly used console is the Maquet Rotaflow(®). Cannulation is most often performed by cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, and nearly all programs ({\textgreater}85\%) involve CT surgeons, perfusionists, and pharmacists.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a third of centers that submitted adult eCPR cases to ELSO have performed ED ECMO. These programs are largely based at academic hospitals, new, and have low volumes. They do not have many formal inclusion or exclusion criteria, and devices and techniques are variable.},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe our institution's experience with implementation of ECLS for out-of-hospital and emergency department (ED) cardiac arrests. Our primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
METHODS: Consecutive patients placed on ECLS in the ED or within one hour of admission after out-of-hospital or ED cardiac arrest were enrolled at two urban academic medical centers in the United States from July 2007-April 2014.
RESULTS: During the study period, 26 patients were included. Average age was 40±15 years, 54\% were male, and 42\% were white. Initial cardiac rhythms were ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 42\%. The average time from initial cardiac arrest to initiation of ECLS was 77 ± 51 min (range 12-180 min). ECLS cannulation was unsuccessful in two patients. Eighteen (69\%) had complications related to ECLS, most commonly bleeding and ischemic events. Four patients (15\%) survived to discharge, three of whom were neurologically intact at 6 months.
CONCLUSION: ECLS shows promise as a rescue strategy for refractory out-of-hospital or ED cardiac arrest but is not without challenges. Further investigations are necessary to refine the technique, patient selection, and ancillary therapeutics.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2015.04.044},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the use of cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasing in adult patients, the field lacks understanding of associated risk factors. While standard intensive care unit risk scores such as SAPS II (simplified acute physiology score II), SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment), and APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II), or disease-specific scores such as MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) and RIFLE (kidney risk, injury, failure, loss of function, ESRD) exist, they may not apply to adult cardiac ECMO patients as their risk factors differ from variables used in these scores.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 73 ECMOs were performed for cardiac support at our institution. Patient demographics and survival were retrospectively analyzed. A new easily calculated score for predicting ECMO mortality was created using identified risk factors from univariate and multivariate analyses, and model discrimination was compared with other scoring systems.
RESULTS: Cardiac ECMO was performed on 73 patients (47 males and 26 females) with a mean age of 48 ± 14 y. Sixty-four percent of patients (47/73) survived ECMO support. Pre-ECMO SAPS II, SOFA, APACHE II, MELD, RIFLE, PRESERVE, and ECMOnet scores, were not correlated with survival. Univariate analysis of pre-ECMO risk factors demonstrated that increased lactate, renal dysfunction, and postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock were risk factors for death. Applying these data into a new simplified cardiac ECMO score (minimal risk = 0, maximal = 5) predicted patient survival. Survivors had a lower risk score (1.8 ± 1.2) versus the nonsurvivors (3.0 ± 0.99), P {\textless} 0.0001.
CONCLUSIONS: Common intensive care unit or disease-specific risk scores calculated for cardiac ECMO patients did not correlate with ECMO survival, whereas a new simplified cardiac ECMO score provides survival predictability.},

	abstract = {Background
Although prehospital advanced airway management (AAM) (i.e., endotracheal intubation [ETI] and insertion of supraglottic airways [SGA]) has been performed for paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), the effect of AAM has not been fully studied. We evaluated the association between prehospital AAM for paediatric OHCA and patient outcomes.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study, using the All-Japan Utstein Registry between 2014 and 2016. We included paediatric patients (age {\textless}18 years) with OHCA. We calculated time-dependent propensity score at each minute after initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by EMS providers, using a Fine-Gray regression model. We sequentially matched patients who received AAM during cardiac arrest to patients at risk of receiving AAM within the same minute (risk-set matching). The primary outcome was 1-month survival. Secondary outcome was 1-month survival with favourable functional status, defined as Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2.
Results
We analysed 3801 paediatric patients with OHCA. 481 patients (12.7\%) received AAM and 3320 (87.3\%) did not. Among the 3801 analysed patients, 912 patients underwent risk-set matching. In the matched cohort, AAM was not associated with 1-month survival (AAM: 52/456 [11.4\%] vs. no AAM: 44/456 [9.6\%]; risk ratio [RR], 1.15 [95\% CI, 0.76–1.73]; risk difference [RD], 1.5\% [−3.0 to 6.1\%]) or favourable functional status (AAM: 9/456 [2.0\%] vs. no AAM: 10/456 [2.2\%]; RR, 0.69 [95\% CI, 0.26–1.79]; RD, −0.8\% [−2.9 to 1.3\%]).
Conclusion
Among paediatric patients with OHCA, we found that prehospital AAM was not associated with 1-month survival or favourable functional status.},

In this study, deep learning algorithms were used to predict the mortality of suspected infected patients in a hospital emergency department. During January 2007 and December 2013, 42,220 patients considered in this study were admitted to the emergency department due to suspected infection. In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01\% in 72 h and 81.59\% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA. We expect that deep learning can effectively assist medical staff in early identification of critical patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesized utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms for screening septic shock in ED would provide better accuracy than qSOFA or MEWS.
METHODS: The study population was adult (≥20 years) patients visiting ED for suspected infection. Target event was septic shock within 24 h after arrival. Demographics, vital signs, level of consciousness, chief complaints (CC) and initial blood test results were used as predictors. CC were embedded into 16-dimensional vector space using singular value decomposition. Six base learners including support vector machine, gradient-boosting machine, random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and ridge regression and their ensembles were tested. We also trained and tested MLP networks with various setting.
RESULTS: A total of 49,560 patients were included and 4817 (9.7\%) had septic shock within 24 h. All ML classifiers significantly outperformed qSOFA score, MEWS and their age-sex adjusted versions with their AUROC ranging from 0.883 to 0.929. The ensembles of the base classifiers showed the best performance and addition of CC embedding was associated with statistically significant increases in performance.
CONCLUSIONS: ML classifiers significantly outperforms clinical scores in screening septic shock at ED triage.},

	abstract = {Background The national field trauma triage guidelines have been widely implemented in US trauma systems, but never prospectively validated. We sought to prospectively validate the guidelines, as applied by out-of-hospital providers, for identifying high-risk trauma patients. Study Design This was an out-of-hospital prospective cohort study from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 with 44 Emergency Medical Services agencies in 7 counties in 2 states. We enrolled injured patients transported to 28 acute care hospitals, including 7 major trauma centers (Level I and II trauma hospitals) and 21 nontrauma hospitals. The primary exposure term was Emergency Medical Services' use of one or more field triage criteria in the national field triage guidelines. Outcomes included Injured Severity Score ≥16 (primary) and critical resource use within 24 hours of emergency department arrival (secondary). Results We enrolled 53,487 injured children and adults transported by Emergency Medical Services to an acute care hospital, 17,633 of which were sampled for the primary analysis; 13.9\% met field triage guidelines, 3.1\% had Injury Severity Score ≥16, and 1.7\% required early critical resources. The sensitivity and specificity of the field triage guidelines were 66.2\% (95\% CI, 60.2-71.7\%) and 87.8\% (95\% CI, 87.7-88.0\%) for Injury Severity Score ≥16 and 80.1\% (95\% CI, 65.8-89.4\%) and 87.3\% (95\% CI 87.1-87.4\%) for early critical resource use. Triage guideline sensitivity decreased with age, from 87.4\% in children to 51.8\% in older adults. Conclusions The national field triage guidelines are relatively insensitive for identifying seriously injured patients and patients requiring early critical interventions, particularly among older adults. © 2016 American College of Surgeons.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are frequently undertriaged. However, the associations between triage patterns and outcomes from a population perspective are unknown. We hypothesized that triage patterns would be associated with differences in outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based, retrospective, cohort study of all injured adults aged 55 years or older, from 3 counties in California and 4 in Utah (2006 to 2007). Prehospital data were linked to trauma registry data, state-level discharge data, emergency department records, and death ﬁles. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality. Patients treated at trauma centers were compared with those treated at nontrauma centers. Undertriage was deﬁned as an Injury Severity Score (ISS) {\textgreater}15, with transport to a nontrauma center.
RESULTS: There were 6,015 patients in the analysis. Patients who were taken to nontrauma centers were, on average, older (79.4 vs 70.7 years, p {\textless} 0.001), more often female (68.6\% vs 50.2\%, p {\textless} 0.01), and less often had an ISS {\textgreater}15 (2.2\% vs 6.7\%, p {\textless} 0.01). There were 244 patients with an ISS {\textgreater}15 and the undertriage rate was 32.8\% (n ¼ 80). Overall 60-day mortality for patients with an ISS {\textgreater}15 was 17\%, with no difference between trauma and nontrauma centers in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. However, the median perpatient costs were \$21,000 higher for severely injured patients taken to trauma centers.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the ﬁrst population-based analysis of triage patterns and outcomes in the elderly. We have shown high rates of undertriage that are not associated with higher mortality, but are associated with higher costs. Future work should focus on determining how to improve outcomes for this population. (J Am Coll Surg 2013;217:569e576. Ó 2013 by the American College of Surgeons)},

	abstract = {Background: Older age is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality after injury. Statewide studies suggest signiﬁcantly injured patients aged  55 y are commonly undertriaged to lower level trauma centers (TCs) or nontrauma centers (NTCs). This study determines whether undertriage is a national phenomenon. Materials and methods: Using the 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, signiﬁcantly injured patients aged  55 y were identiﬁed by diagnosis and new injury severity score (NISS)  9. Undertriage was deﬁned as deﬁnitive care anywhere other than level I or II TCs. Weighted descriptive analysis compared characteristics of patients by triage status. Multivariable logistic regression determined predictors of undertriage, controlling for hospital characteristics, injury severity, and comorbidities.
Results: Of 4,152,541 emergency department (ED) visits meeting inclusion criteria, 74.0\% were treated at lower level TCs or NTCs. Patients at level I and II TCs more commonly had NISS  9 (22.2\% versus 12.3\%, P {\textless} 0.001), but among all patients with NISS  9, 61.3\% were undertriaged to a lower level TC or a NTC. On multivariable logistic regression, factors independently associated with higher odds of being undertriaged were increasing age, female gender, and fall-related injuries. A subgroup analysis examined urban and suburban areas only where access to a TC is more likely and found that 55.8\% of patients’ age were undertriaged.
Conclusions: There is substantial undertriage of patients aged  55 y nationwide. Over half of signiﬁcantly injured older patients are not treated at level I or II TCs. The impact of undertriage should be determined to ensure older patients receive trauma care at the optimal site.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Prehospital acquisition of electrocardiograms (ECG) has been consistently associated with reduced door-to-balloon times in the treatment of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). There is little evidence establishing best hospital practices once the ECG has been received by the emergency department (ED). This study evaluates the use of a push notification system to reduce delays in cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation for prehospital STEMI.
Methods: In this prospective before-and-after study, we collected prehospital ECGs with computer interpretation of STEMI from May 2012 to October 2013. Push notifications were implemented June 1, 2013. During the study period, we collected timestamps of when the prehospital ECG was received (email timestamp of receiving account), CCL team activation (timestamp in paging system), and patient arrival (timestamp in ED tracking board). When prehospital ECGs were received in the ED, an audible alert was played via the Vocera WiFi communication system, notifying nursing staff that an ECG was available for physician interpretation. We compared the time from receiving the ECG to activation of the CCL before and after the audible notification was implemented.
Results: Of the 56 cases received, we included 45 in our analysis (20 cases with pre-arrival CCL activation and 25 with post-arrival activation). For the pre-arrival group, the interval from ECG received to CCL activation prior to implementation was 9.1 minutes with a standard deviation (SD) of 5.7 minutes. After implementation, the interval was reduced to 3.33 minutes with a SD of 1.63 minutes. Delay was decreased by 5.8 minutes (p {\textless} 0.01). Post-implementation activation times were more consistent, demonstrated by a decrease in SD from 5.75 to 1.63 min (p {\textless} 0.01). For patients with CCL activation after arrival, there was no significant change in mean delay after implementation.
Conclusion: In this small, single-center observational study, we demonstrated that the use of push notifications to ED staff alerting that a prehospital STEMI ECG was received correlated with a small reduction in, and increased consistency of, ED CCL activation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the incidence and success rate of out-of-hospital tracheal intubation (TI) and ventilation of children, taking account of the type of healthcare provider involved.
Methods: A prospective observational study to analyse a consecutive group of children for which a helicopter-transported medical team (HMT) was called. In all cases, the emergency medical service (EMS)-paramedics arrived at the scene ﬁrst. Data regarding type of incident, physiological parameters, treatment, and survival until hospital discharge were collected and subsequently analysed.
Results: Of the 300 children examined and treated by the HMT on scene, 155 (52\%) children required out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. Ninety-ﬁve children had an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) rating of 3—4: the EMS-paramedics performed bag-valve-mask-ventilation (BVMV) until arrival with subsequent TI carried out by the HMT (54 children, survival 63\%) or the EMSparamedics performed TI themselves (41 children, subsequent correction of tube/ventilation by HMT in 37\% and survival rate 5\%). Two hundred and ﬁve children had an initial GCS of 5—15, from which 60 children required TI (survival rate 67\%) and 145 children required no TI (survival rate 100\%).
Conclusion: We do not recommend early TI by EMS-paramedics in children with a GCS of 3—4. The rate of complications of this procedure is unacceptably high. BVMV is the preferred choice for ventilation by paramedics, whenever possible. Out-of-hospital TI performed by HMT is safe and effective. The HMT has skills in advanced airway management not provided by the EMS.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is widely used for airway management of children in the out-of-hospital setting, despite a lack of controlled trials demonstrating a positive effect on survival or neurological outcome.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival and neurological outcomes of pediatric patients treated with bag-valve-mask ventilation (BVM) with those of patients treated with BVM followed by ETI.
DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial, in which patients were assigned to interventions by calendar day from March 15, 1994, through January 1, 1997.
SETTING: Two large, urban, rapid-transport emergency medical services (EMS) systems.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 830 consecutive patients aged 12 years or younger or estimated to weigh less than 40 kg who required airway management; 820 were available for follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive either BVM (odd days; n = 410) or BVM followed by ETI (even days; n = 420).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival to hospital discharge and neurological status at discharge from an acute care hospital compared by treatment group.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in survival between the BVM group (123/404 [30\%]) and the ETI group (110/416 [26\%]) (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.11) or in the rate of achieving a good neurological outcome (BVM, 92/404 [23\%] vs ETI, 85/416 [20\%]) (OR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.62-1.22).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the addition of out-of-hospital ETI to a paramedic scope of practice that already includes BVM did not improve survival or neurological outcome of pediatric patients treated in an urban EMS system.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Pediatric airway control, including endotracheal intubation (ETI), presents a clinical challenge in the prehospital setting. Endotracheal intubation is recommended for serious head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textless}=8). We evaluated the frequency of ETI in pediatric and adult patients with {\textless}=8 in the field, subsequently transported by a hospital-based, helicopter emergency medical service (HHEMS).
METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study of pediatric patients ({\textless}=14 years) and adult patients with GCS {\textless}=8 transported by HHEMS from January 1988 through March 1994 was conducted. Significance was determined by chi-square analysis.
RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 63 (15\%) pediatric patients and 353 (85\%) adults. Of the pediatric patients, 38 (60\%) were intubated endotracheally; mean age was 7; mean injury severity score (ISS) was 28. Of adults, 267 (76\%) were intubated endotracheally; mean age was 35; mean ISS was 33. A 16-percentage-point difference in frequency of successful ETI between groups was found to be significant (p {\textless}=0.01). Of 25 nonintubated pediatric (PED) patients, unsuccessful attempts were made on 20 (80\%); 14 of 25 (56\%) had significant head injuries evident on computerized tomography (CT) scan. Of 86 nonintubated adults, unsuccessful attempts were made on 29 (34\%); 61 (71\%) had significant head injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric coma patients were not intubated with the same frequency as adults. This discrepancy between groups was secondary to a higher failure rate in the pediatric group. Intubation was attempted in 92\% of pediatric patients versus 84\% of the adults. Unsuccessful intubation attempts in the pediatric group, 20 of 58 (34\%), were compared with 29 of 296 (9.8\%) in the adult group.

Our retrospective study covered a 38-month period and included all prehospital victims of medical cardiopulmonary arrest under the age of 19 years. Data were collected from field assessment forms and validated by hospital charts, autopsy reports, coroner's reports, death certificates, and emergency medical services central dispatch logs. Of 63 victims of medical cardiorespiratory arrest, 42 had intubating paramedics present at the scene. Twenty-eight of 42 patients (66\%) had endotracheal intubation attempted. Eighteen of 28 attempts (64\%) were successful, associated with a major complication rate of 7\% (two of 28) and a minor complication rate of 39\% (11 of 28).

Fifty-seven percent of the ETIs were attempted in the field, 22\% in transferring hospital, and 21\% at the TC.

Several studies reported that ETI requires considerable skill and experience and if performed incorrectly, may result in serious adverse events. Unrecognized tube misplacement or oesophageal intubation is associated with high prehospital morbidity. This study investigates the usability of supraglottic airway devices compared to ETI and the skill retention of 41 previously inexperienced paramedics following training using a manikin model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}41 paramedics participated in this study. None had prior experience in airway management, apart from bag-valve ventilation. After a standardised audio-visual lecture lasting 45min, the paramedics participated in a practical demonstration using the advanced patient simulator SimMan$^{\textrm{®}}$ (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). Afterwards, paramedics were instructed to perform airway-management using seven different techniques to secure the airway (ETI, Laryngeal mask unique [LMA], Proseal, Laryngeal tube disposable [LT-D$^{\textrm{®}}$], I-Gel$^{\textrm{®}}$, Combitube$^{\textrm{®}}$, and EasyTube$^{\textrm{®}}$) following a randomized sequence. Participants underwent reassessment after 3 months without any further training or practice in airway-management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}During the initial training session, ETI was successfully performed in 78\% of cases, while 3 months later the success rate was 58\%. For the supraglottic airway devices, five out of six were successfully used by all paramedics at both time points, the exception being Proseal$^{\textrm{®}}$. Our data show successful skill retention (success rate: 100\%) after 3 months for five out of six supraglottic airway devices. Time to ventilation (T3) was significantly less for LMA, LT-D$^{\textrm{®}}$ and I-Gel$^{\textrm{®}}$ at all time points compared to ETI.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}ETI performed by inexperienced paramedics is associated with a low success rate. In contrast, supraglottic airway devices like LMA, LT-D$^{\textrm{®}}$, I-Gel$^{\textrm{®}}$, Combitube$^{\textrm{®}}$ and EasyTube$^{\textrm{®}}$ are fast, safe and easy-to-use. Within the limitations of a manikin-study, this study suggests that inexperienced medical staff might benefit from using supraglottic airway devices for emergency airway management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In these testing situations, it is important that the assessments are standardized, the scores are accurate and reliable, and the resulting decisions regarding competence are equitable and defensible. For the decisions to be valid, justifiable standards, or cut-scores, must be set. Unfortunately, unlike the body of research specifically dedicated to multiple-choice examinations, relatively little research has been conducted on standard-setting methods appropriate for use with performance-based assessments. The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with some guidance on how to set defensible standards on performance assessments, especially those that utilize standardized patients in simulated medical encounters. Various methods are discussed and contrasted, highlighting the relevant strengths and weaknesses. In addition, based on the prevailing literature and research, ideas for future studies and potential augmentations to current performance-based standard setting protocols are advanced.},

Ninety-seven percent (339 of 349) of the responding (349 of 523) paramedic training sites reported that PETI was taught in their programs. The results of the survey did not identify a predominate method for instructing paramedics in PETI. Lectures, mannequins, operating room demonstration, animal models, and cadavers were used in various ways for teaching the skill.Conclusion:Endotracheal intubation is an accepted standard in prehospital pediatric care. This standard exists with marginal support in published literature and study of prehospital PETI is needed to define the benefits, risks, and optimal instruction methods for the procedure.},

	abstract = {Background: During resuscitation decisions are made frequently and based on limited information in a stressful environment. Aim: This systematic review aimed to identify human factors affecting decision-making in challenging or stressful situations in resuscitation. The secondary aim was to identify methods of improving decision-making performance under stress.
Methods: The databases PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library were searched from their commencement to the 13th of April 2019. MeSH terms and key words were combined (Stress* OR “human factor”) AND Decision. Articles were included if they involved decision makers in medicine where decisions were made under challenging circumstances, with a comparator group and an outcome measure relating to change in decision-making performance.
Results: 22,368 records in total were initially identified, from which 82 full text studies were reviewed and 16 finally included. The included studies ranged from 1995 to 2018 and included a total of 570 participants. The studies were conducted in several different countries and settings, with participants of varying experience and backgrounds. Of the 16 studies, 5 were randomised controlled trials, 3 of which were deemed to have a high risk of bias. The stressors identified were (i) illness severity (ii) socio-evaluative, (iii) noise, (iv) fatigue. The mitigators identified were (i) cognitive aids including checklists, (ii) stress management training and (iii) meditation.
Conclusions: Human factors contributing to decision-making during resuscitation are identified and can be mitigated by tailored stress training and cognitive aids. Understanding these factors may have implications for clinician education and the development of decision-support tools.},

	abstract = {Background: One critical hurdle for clinical trial recruitment is the lack of an efficient method for identifying subjects who meet the eligibility criteria. Given the large volume of data documented in electronic health records (EHRs), it is labor-intensive for the staff to screen relevant information, particularly within the time frame needed. To facilitate subject identification, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning–based system, Automated Clinical Trial Eligibility Screener (ACTES), which analyzes structured data and unstructured narratives automatically to determine patients’ suitability for clinical trial enrollment. In this study, we integrated the ACTES into clinical practice to support real-time patient screening.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate ACTES’s impact on the institutional workflow, prospectively and comprehensively. We hypothesized that compared with the manual screening process, using EHR-based automated screening would improve efficiency of patient identification, streamline patient recruitment workflow, and increase enrollment in clinical trials.
Methods: The ACTES was fully integrated into the clinical research coordinators’ (CRC) workflow in the pediatric emergency department (ED) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. The system continuously analyzed EHR information for current ED patients and recommended potential candidates for clinical trials. Relevant patient eligibility information was presented in real time on a dashboard available to CRCs to facilitate their recruitment. To assess the system’s effectiveness, we performed a multidimensional, prospective evaluation for a 12-month period, including a time-and-motion study, quantitative assessments of enrollment, and postevaluation usability surveys collected from the CRCs.
Results: Compared with manual screening, the use of ACTES reduced the patient screening time by 34\% (P{\textless}.001). The saved time was redirected to other activities such as study-related administrative tasks (P=.03) and work-related conversations (P=.006) that streamlined teamwork among the CRCs. The quantitative assessments showed that automated screening improved the numbers of subjects screened, approached, and enrolled by 14.7\%, 11.1\%, and 11.1\%, respectively, suggesting the potential of ACTES in streamlining recruitment workflow. Finally, the ACTES achieved a system usability scale of 80.0 in the postevaluation surveys, suggesting that it was a good computerized solution.
Conclusions: By leveraging NLP and machine learning technologies, the ACTES demonstrated good capacity for improving efficiency of patient identification. The quantitative assessments demonstrated the potential of ACTES in streamlining recruitment workflow and improving patient enrollment. The postevaluation surveys suggested that the system was a good computerized solution with satisfactory usability.},

	abstract = {Objective: Chief complaint (CC) is among the earliest health information recorded at the beginning of a patient's visit to an emergency department (ED). We propose a heuristic methodology for automatically mapping the freetext data into a structured list of CCs.
Methods: A comprehensive structured list categorizing CCs was developed by experienced Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians. Using this list, we developed a natural language processing-based algorithm, referred to as Chief Complaint Mapper (CCMapper), for automatically mapping a CC into the most appropriate category (ies). We trained and validated CCMapper using free-text CC data from the Mayo Clinic ED in Rochester, MN. We developed a consensus-based validation approach to handle both indifferences and disagreements between the two EM physicians who manually mapped a random sample of free-text CCs into categories within the structured list.
Results: The kappa statistic demonstrated a high level of agreement (κ = 0.958) between the two physicians with less than 2\% human error. CCMapper achieved a total sensitivity of 94.2\% with a specificity of 99.8\% and Fscore of 94.7\% on the validation set. The sensitivity of CCMapper when mapping free-text data with multiple CCs was 82.3\% with a specificity of 99.1\% and total F-score of 82.3\%.
Conclusion: Due to its simplicity, high performance, and capability of incorporating new free-text CC data, CCMapper can be readily adopted by other EDs to support clinical decision making. CCMapper can facilitate the development of predictive models for the type and timing of important events in ED (e.g., ICU admission).},

Emergency care research, in particular, poses several unique challenges in this rapidly evolving field. A group of content experts was recently convened to identify research priorities related to barriers to the application of data science to emergency care research. These recommendations included: 1) developing methods for cross-platform identification and linkage of patients; 2) creating central, deidentified, open-access databases; 3) improving methodologies for visualization and analysis of intensively sampled data; 4) developing methods to identify and standardize electronic medical record data quality; 5) improving and utilizing natural language processing; 6) developing and utilizing syndrome or complaint-based based taxonomies of disease; 7) developing practical and ethical framework to leverage electronic systems for controlled trials; 8) exploring technologies to help enable clinical trials in the emergency setting; and 9) training emergency care clinicians in data science and data scientists in emergency care medicine.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare logistic regression and neural network modeling strategies to predict hospital admission or transfer following initial presentation to Emergency Department (ED) triage with and without the addition of natural language processing elements.
METHODS: Using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), a cross-sectional probability sample of United States EDs from 2012 and 2013 survey years, we developed several predictive models with the outcome being admission to the hospital or transfer vs. discharge home. We included patient characteristics immediately available after the patient has presented to the ED and undergone a triage process. We used this information to construct logistic regression (LR) and multilayer neural network models (MLNN) which included natural language processing (NLP) and principal component analysis from the patient's reason for visit. Ten-fold cross validation was used to test the predictive capacity of each model and receiver operating curves (AUC) were then calculated for each model.
RESULTS: Of the 47,200 ED visits from 642 hospitals, 6,335 (13.42\%) resulted in hospital admission (or transfer). A total of 48 principal components were extracted by NLP from the reason for visit fields, which explained 75\% of the overall variance for hospitalization. In the model including only structured variables, the AUC was 0.824 (95\% CI 0.818-0.830) for logistic regression and 0.823 (95\% CI 0.817-0.829) for MLNN. Models including only free-text information generated AUC of 0.742 (95\% CI 0.731- 0.753) for logistic regression and 0.753 (95\% CI 0.742-0.764) for MLNN. When both structured variables and free text variables were included, the AUC reached 0.846 (95\% CI 0.839-0.853) for logistic regression and 0.844 (95\% CI 0.836-0.852) for MLNN.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of hospital admission or transfer for patients who presented to ED triage overall was good, and was improved with the inclusion of free text data from a patient's reason for visit regardless of modeling approach. Natural language processing and neural networks that incorporate patient-reported outcome free text may increase predictive accuracy for hospital admission.},

	abstract = {Objective To predict hospital admission at the time of ED triage using patient history in addition to information collected at triage. Methods This retrospective study included all adult ED visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80\%), validation (10\%), and test (10\%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model. Results A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7\%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95\% CI 0.86–0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.87–0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% CI 0.87–0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95\% CI 0.86–0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.87–0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% CI 0.87–0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95\% CI 0.91–0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.92–0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95\% CI 0.92–0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50\% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.91–0.91). Conclusion Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Mis-triage including undertriage and overtriage is associated with morbidity and mortality. It is not clear what the extent of mis-triage rates among traumatic patients is. The aim of this study is to determine of mis-triage (undertriage and overtriage) in traumatic patients.
METHODS: This study was a systematic review about mis-triage rate among trauma patients. The following electronic databases were searched (Web of Knowledge, Scoups, PubMed, Cochrane library) from conception through February 1, 2018. Search terms included trauma, undertriage, and over-triage. Inclusion criteria were studies which report overtriage or undertriage rate in regard to triage of trauma patients; patients older than 18 years old, English-written papers. Irrelevant papers as well as conference abstract, letter, editorial, thesis and studies on special population were excluded. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Checklist was used to examine review process.
RESULTS: Twenty-one papers were included in this study. Sample size ranged from 244 to 550683 trauma patients. Fourteen studies originated from USA. Definition of mis-triage was summarized into four categories: ISS used to define undertriage error, formula for mis-triage (1-sensitivity), need for life-saving emergency intervention and patients triaged to a non-trauma center. Undertriage rate ranged from 1 to 71.9\% and overtriage rate ranged from 19 to 79\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The standardization of mis-triage definitions is vital to estimate true rate of mis-triage among different studies and clarify the role of triage scales. The trauma triage scales need to be further developed to provide more valid and reliable results.},

The following search engines and tools were assessed: Google Web, Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Clinical Queries set to narrow search, and PubMed Clinical Queries set to broad search. The ﬁrst 60 hits, in the order of most recent ﬁrst, were reviewed and assessed for quality of evidence, relevance versus irrelevance, and number of high-quality hits, and each search instrument was graded for overall readability with a visual analog scale. Quality relevance ratio, deﬁned as the ratio of high-quality relevant hits to low-quality irrelevant hits, was calculated for each tool according to these searches.
Results: Overall, PubMed Clinical Queries narrow search had the highest quality relevance ratio, averaging 0.85. PubMed Clinical Queries narrow search also returned high-quality relevant hits without the need to ﬁlter out as many low-quality irrelevant hits. Google Scholar retrieved the highest number of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, and returned the most complete search results, ﬁnding relevant citations other search engines did not. Google Web consistently had the lowest quality relevance ratio and contained many duplicate hits.
Conclusion: For the common clinical questions assessed in this study, PubMed Clinical Queries narrow search had the highestquality, most relevant, and most readable hits. Google Scholar performed well, in some cases retrieving citations that other search engines did not. PubMed and Google Web were not as efﬁcient. [Ann Emerg Med. 2019;-:1-8.]},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) view over- and undertriage rates based on trauma team activation (TTA) criteria as surrogate markers for quality trauma patient care. Undertriage occurs when classifying patients as not needing a TTA when they do. Over-triage occurs when a TTA is unnecessarily activated. ACS-COT recommends undertriage {\textless}5\% and overtriage 25-35\%. We sought to improve the under-triage and over-triage rates at our Level II Pediatric Trauma Center by updating our outdated trauma team activation criteria in an evidence-based fashion to better identify severely injured children and improving adherance to following established trauma team activation criteria.
METHODS: This study was designed prospectively as a Process Improvement Patient Safety (PIPS) project in two phases. Data was obtained from our trauma registry. Prior to the initiation of Phase I, the TTA was modified using the best available evidence at the time. A Base Station report was modified to include elements of the TTA to be checked when EMS called prior to arrival to guide in activation. Phase I of the study (April 1-June 30, 2011) involved improving adherence to activating a trauma according to our newly revised TTA criteria. Phase II of the study (July 1, 2011-June 30, 2012) moved the trauma team activation responsibility primarily to nursing (collaborating with MDs) and including activation criteria regarding transfers-in from outside hospitals. Triage rates were calculated using the Cribari method: undertriage=patients with an ISS {\textgreater}15 for which a major or modified was not activated, and overtriage=patients with an ISS {\textless}16 for which a major was activated.
RESULTS: 2011 Q1 YTD data was used as a baseline comparison. Baseline undertriage was 15\% and overtriage was 75\%. Phase I demonstrated 90\% use of the redesigned Base Station report reflecting the new TTA criteria and was validated by RN/MD signatures. This resulted in an undertriage rate of 10\% (12/118) and an overtriage rate of 20\% (1/5). During Phase II, there was 100\% use of the newly redesigned Base Station report. Phase IIa (concluding the data collection for 2011) demonstrated an undertriage rate of 8.4\% (19/226) and an overtriage rate of 38\% (5/13). Data during Phase IIb indicated an undertriage rate of 4.7\% (12/251 pts) and overtriage rate of 54\% (7/13). During baseline phase of the study, 50\% of major patients went to the OR from the ER. During Phase I all major activations required admission to the PICU (4) or the OR (1). Finally, during Q2 2012 (the last quarter of Phase II), 25\% of majors went to OR (2/8), 50\% to ICU (4/8), 12.5\% to Med-Surg (1/8), and 12.5\% to home (1/8).
CONCLUSIONS: Standardization of process resulted in improved, sustainable under-/overtriage rates. Undertriage rates dropped from 15\% to 5\% undertriage, the ACS-recommended standard. Appropriate triage appears to have correlated with appropriate utilization of resources.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In-hospital trauma team activation criteria are formulated to identify severely injured patients requiring specialized multidisciplinary care. Efficacy of trauma activation (TA) criteria is commonly measured by emergency department (ED) disposition, injury severity score, and mortality. Necessity of critical ED interventions is another measure that has been proposed to evaluate the appropriateness of TA criteria.
METHODS: Two-year retrospective cohort study of 1715 patients from our trauma registry at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center. We abstracted data on acute interventions, level and criterion of TA, ED disposition, and mortality. We report odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), positive predictive value, and frequency of acute interventions.
RESULTS: Trauma activation was initiated for 947 (55\%) of the 1715 patients. There were 426 ED interventions performed on 235 patients (14\%); 67.8\% were in level 1 activations; 17.6\% in level 2, and 14.6\% in level 3. Highest-level activations were highly associated with need for ED interventions (OR, 16.1; 95\% CI, 11.5-22.4). The ORs for requiring an ED intervention were low for lower level activations (OR, 0.4; 95\% CI, 0.3-0.5), trauma service consults (OR, 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.2-0.4), and certain mechanism-based criteria. The ORs for ED intervention for isolated motor vehicle collision (0.2; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.7), isolated all-terrain vehicle rollover (0.4; 95\% CI, 0.1-1.7), and suspected spinal cord injury (0.5; 95\% CI, 0.1-3.7) were significantly lower than 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Highest-level activation criteria correlate with high utilization of ED resources and interventions. Lower level activation criteria and trauma service consult criteria are not highly correlated with need for ED interventions. Downgrading isolated motor vehicle collision and all-terrain vehicle rollovers and suspected spinal cord injury to lower level activations could decrease the overtriage rate, and adding age-specific bradycardia as a physiologic criterion could improve our undertriage rate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) advises trauma centers maintain {\textless}5\% undertriage rate (UTR), but provides limited rationale for this figure. We sought to determine whether patients managed at Level I/II trauma centers with a UTR less than 5\% had improved outcomes compared with centers with greater than 5\% UTR. We hypothesized that similar overall adjusted outcomes would be observed at trauma centers in Pennsylvania regardless of their compliance with ACSCOT undertriage recommendation.
METHODS: The Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study database was retrospectively queried for all trauma patients managed at accredited adult Level I/II trauma centers (n = 27) from 2003 to 2015. Patients with missing data on Injury Severity Score and/or Trauma Activation Status were excluded from the analysis. Institutional UTR were calculated for all trauma centers based on ACSCOT criteria (Injury Severity Score {\textgreater}15; no trauma activation) and were categorized into less than 5\% or greater than 5\% subgroups. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the adjusted impact of management at centers with less than 5\% undertriage. Statistical significance was set at p less than 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 404,315 patients from 27 trauma centers met inclusion criteria. Institutional UTRs ranged from 0\% to 20.5\%, with 15 centers exhibiting UTR less than 5\% and 12 centers with UTR greater than 5\%. No clinically meaningful difference in unadjusted mortality rate was observed between subgroups ({\textless}5\% UTR: 5.19\%; {\textgreater}5\% UTR: 5.20\%; p {\textless} 0.001). In adjusted analysis, no difference in mortality was found for patients managed at centers with less than 5\% UTR compared to those with greater than 5\% UTR (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval, 0.85-1.33; p = 0.608).
CONCLUSION: Achieving ACSCOT less than 5\% undertriage standards appears to have limited impact on institutional mortality. Further research should seek to identify new triage criteria that can be uniformly applied to all trauma centers.

This study compared the incidence and predictors of complications and mortality among brain-injured older adults treated at TCs and NTCs. This secondary analysis of New York inpatient data included patients aged 55+ years, primary brain injury diagnosis, and acute care hospital admission. Interfacility transfers and nontraumatic brain injuries were excluded. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes identified complications and mortality. Injury severity was determined by mapping ICD-9-CM diagnoses to Abbreviated Injury Scale 2005 Revision 2008 dictionary scores. A subgroup analysis of 1,594 patients with New Injury Severity Scores greater than 15 was performed to examine complications and mortality. This study included 7,138 patients who met inclusion criteria. Predictors of subgroup complications included chronic renal failure, odds ratio (OR) = 2.251 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.470-3.447), p {\textless} .001; major operating room procedure, OR = 2.349 (CI = 1.679-3.285), p {\textless} .001; number of diagnoses, OR = 1.201 (CI = 1.158-1.245), p {\textless} .001; and number of procedures, OR = 1.119 (CI = 1.077-1.162), p £ .001. Mortality predictors included age, OR = 1.031 (CI = 1.017-1.045), p {\textless} .001; preexisting coagulopathy, OR = 1.753 (C = 1.130-2.719), p = .012; number of procedures, OR = 1.122 (CI = 1.081-1.166), p {\textless} .001; acute renal failure, OR = 3.114 (CI = 1.672-5.797), p {\textless} .001; systemic inflammatory response syndrome, OR = 4.058 (CI = 1.463-11.258), p = .007; adult respiratory distress syndrome, OR = 3.179 (CI = 1.673-6.041), p {\textless} .001; and subarachnoid bleed, OR = 2.667 (CI = 1.415-5.029), p = .002. Nearly 23\% of the severely/critically injured patients experienced 1 or more complications. Incidence of complications was low and comparable for TCs and NTCs. The proportion of deaths was slightly higher at TCs but not significant. The most prevalent complications carry a high mortality risk.},

This study aimed to describe the published variation in (1) highest level of hospital trauma team activation criteria for pediatric patients and (2) hospital trauma team membership and (3) compare these finding to the current ACS recommendations.
METHODS: Using an Ovid MEDLINE In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations search, any published description of hospital trauma team activation criteria for children that used information captured in the prehospital setting was identified. Only studies of children were included. If the study included both adults and children, it was included if the number of children assessed with the criteria was included.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies spanning 20 years and 13,184 children were included. Hospital trauma team activation and trauma team membership were variable. Nearly all (92\%) of the trauma criteria used physiologic factors. Penetrating trauma (83\%) was frequently included in the trauma team activation criteria. Mechanisms of injury (52\%) were least likely to be included in the highest level of activation. No predictable pattern of criterion adoption was found. Only 2 of the published criteria and 1 of published trauma team membership are consistent with the current American College of Surgeons recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Published hospital trauma team activation criteria and trauma team membership for children were variable. Future prospective studies are needed to define the optimal hospital trauma team activation criteria and trauma team membership and assess its impact on improving outcomes for children.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of accomplishing the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma benchmarks of less than 5\% undertriage (treatment of patients with moderate to severe injuries at nontrauma centers [NTCs]) and less than 50\% overtriage (transfer of patients with minor injuries to trauma centers [TCs]) given current practice patterns by describing transfer patterns for patients taken initially to NTCs and estimating volume shifts and potential lives saved if full implementation were to occur.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of adult trauma patients initially evaluated at NTCs in Pennsylvania (between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2005). We used published estimates of mortality risk reduction associated with treatment at TCs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Undertriage and overtriage rates, estimated patient volume shifts, and number of lives saved.
RESULTS: A total of 93,880 adult trauma patients were initially evaluated at NTCs in Pennsylvania between 2001 and 2005. Undertriage was 69\%; overtriage was 53\%. Achieving less than 5\% undertriage would require the transfer of 18,945 patients per year, a 5-fold increase from current practice (3650 transfers per year). Given an absolute mortality risk reduction of 1.9\% for patients with moderate to severe injuries treated at TCs, this change in practice would save 99 potential lives per year or would require 191 transfers per year to save 1 potential life.
CONCLUSIONS: Given current practice patterns, American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma recommendations for the regionalization of trauma patients may not be feasible. To achieve 5\% undertriage, TCs must increase their capacity 5-fold, physicians at NTCs must increase their capacity to discriminate between moderate to severe and other injuries, or the guidelines must be modified.},

METHODS: Severely injured adults ≥16 years were identified from the 2010-2012 NTDB. UT was defined as those who received definitive care or died at hospitals without state or ACS level I or II verification. Risk factors for UTT and the impact of UT on mortality were determined.
RESULTS: Of 348,394 severely injured patients, 11,578 (3.3\%) were UT. Older, less severely injured, and certain minority patients were most likely to be UT. After risk adjustment, predictors of UT included increased age and minority race. Increased injury severity and comorbidity were protective (all p {\textless} .05). Mortality was greater in UT patients regardless of ISS (OR = 1.32, p {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: The low UT rate in this study demonstrates the effectiveness of triage practices amongst ACS and state verified centers however age, race, and insurance disparities in UT should be improved.},

	abstract = {Importance: National anatomic triage criteria prescribe specific transport rules for injured patients. However, there is limited information about patients with firearm-related injuries undertriaged to nondesignated facilities (ie, hospitals without specialized trauma teams or units), including what clinical outcomes are achieved and how many are transferred to a higher level of care. Without these data, it is difficult to make informed regional or national policy decisions about triage practices. Undertriage of firearm-related injuries is a good model for evaluating the undertriage of patients with trauma because the anatomic triage criteria for patients with firearm-related injuries are simple.
Objective: To evaluate the prevalence, spatial distribution, and clinical outcomes of undertriage of firearm-related injuries.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is a retrospective analysis of firearm-related injuries in residents of Cook County, Illinois, from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013. Outpatient and inpatient hospital databases were used. Participants included patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification firearm-related cause-of-injury codes. Data were collected all at once in August 2014. Data analysis took place from March 12, 2015, to February 1, 2016.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Undertriaged cases were defined as patients who met the national anatomic triage criteria for transfer to higher-level trauma center care. Spatial distribution, injury severity, and clinical outcomes, including death, were analyzed.
Results: Of the 9886 patients included in this analysis, 8955 (90.6\%) were male, 7474 (75.6\%) were African American, and 5376 (54.4\%) were aged 15 to 24 years.In Cook County, Illinois, where there are 19 trauma centers, 2842 of 9886 (28.7\%) firearm-related injuries were initially treated in nondesignated facilities. Among the 4934 cases with firearm-related injury who met the anatomic triage criteria, 884 (17.9\%) received initial treatment at a nondesignated facility and only 92 (10.4\%) were transferred to a designated trauma center. Significant spatial clustering was identified on the west side of Chicago and in the southern parts of Chicago and Cook County. In the multivariable models, patients treated in nondesignated facilities were less likely to die than were patients treated in designated trauma centers.
Conclusions and Relevance: Undertriage of firearm-related injuries was much more prevalent than expected. Although the likelihood of dying during hospitalization was greater among patients treated in designated trauma centers, these patients were substantially in worse condition across all measures of injury severity. A smaller proportion of patients treated in designated trauma centers died during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. This study highlights the need for better regional coordination, especially with interhospital transfers, as well as the importance of assessing the distribution of emergency medical services resources to make the trauma care system more effective and equitable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interfacility transfer of undertriaged patients to higher-level trauma centers has been found to result in a delay of appropriate care and an increase in mortality. To address this, for the last 10 years our region has used 911 emergency medical services (EMS) paramedics for rapid re-triage of undertriaged patients to our institution's Level I trauma center. We sought to determine whether using 911 EMS for re-triage to our institution was associated with worse outcomes-with mortality as the primary end point-compared with direct EMS transport from point of injury.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed all trauma activations to our institution during a 16-month period; 3,394 active traumas were analyzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients (8\%) arrived via 911 EMS re-triage and 3,124 (92\%) arrived via direct EMS transport. Total EMS transport time was significantly longer (122.5 minutes vs 33.7 minutes; p {\textless} 0.001) between the 2 groups, but there was no significant difference in mortality rates (4.1\% vs 3.6\%; p = 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that although using 911 EMS for re-triage is associated with an increase in total transport time, it does not result in an increase in mortality compared with direct EMS transport. We conclude that the use of 911 EMS can be considered a safe method to re-triage patients to higher-level trauma centers.},

Factors that contributed to being UT in the emergency department were investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 4534 elderly patients constitute this  analysis, of which 15.1 per cent were UT. The UT patients were more likely to die, when adjusted for Revised Trauma Score, Glasgow Coma score, the occurrence of ≥1 complication, and whether the patient was on Coumadin.

	doi = {10.1016/j.injury.2010.05.004},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appropriate triage of the trauma patient is essential to ensure prompt access to definitive care. Many trauma centres use a "tiered" trauma call protocol with the intention of providing a match between the facility's resources and the needs of the patient. This study describes the incidence and impact of undertriage on the trauma patient in the context of an Australian level 1 trauma centre with a tiered trauma call system.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospective data collected through the Trauma Registry. Undertriage was defined as sustaining an injury severity score greater than 15 and receiving a non optimal response (i.e., trauma standby call or no call). The level of association between outcome measures (such as LOS in ED, time to OT) and the level of trauma call the patient received was assessed using a general linear model, controlling for injury severity and haemodynamic stability.
RESULTS: Between February 2004 and November 2008, 5233 patients meeting trauma criteria presented to the study hospital. There was an undertriage rate of 42\% and overtriage rate of 21\%. Patients were more likely to be undertriaged if they were older, self-presented, their cause of injury was assault or their head or chest were their most severely injured body region. Undertriaged patients had a significantly longer LOS in the ED (2 h) than appropriately triaged patients.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of a tiered trauma call system resulted in significant undertriage,especially if the patient was older, had been assaulted or had a head/chest injury. Undertriaged patients experienced delay to definitive care. This study has highlighted the importance of compliance with trauma team activation criteria, trauma monitoring and evaluation.},

Trauma centers are designed and staffed to treat severely injured patients and are increasingly burdened by cases involving less-serious injury. Yet, a cost evaluation of the Field Triage national guideline has never been performed.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential cost savings associated with overtriage for the 1999 and 2006 versions of the Field Triage Guideline.
METHODS: Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Trauma Databank (NTDB) produced estimates of injury-related ambulatory transports and exposure to the Field Triage guideline. Case costs were approximated using a cost distribution curve of all cases found in the NTDB. A two-way sensitivity analysis was also used to determine the impact of data uncertainty on medical costs and the reduction in trauma center visits (12\%) after implementation of the 2006 Field Triage guideline compared with the 1999 Field Triage guideline.
RESULTS: At a 40\% overtriage rate, the average case cost was \$16,434. The cost average of 44.2\% reduction in case costs if patients were treated in a non-trauma center compared with a trauma center was found in the literature. Implementation of the 2006 Field Triage guideline produced a \$7,264 cost savings per case, or an estimated annual national savings of \$568,000,000.
CONCLUSION: Application of the 2006 Field Triage guideline helps emergency medical services personnel manage overtriage in trauma centers, which could result in a significant national cost savings.},

METHODS: Injured children younger than 15 years and transported by emergency medical services (EMS) from the scene of injury between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 were identified using the institution's trauma registry. Logistic regression was used to study the main outcomes of interest, full TTA (FTTA) and ED disposition.
RESULTS: Out of 3,213 children, 1,991 were eligible and analyzed. Only 279 children initiated the FTTA and 73.9\% were admitted. Having a chest injury, abnormal heart rate or Glasgow Coma Scale less than 9 (GCSLT9) in the field was associated with higher odds of initiating the FTTA (odds ratio [OR] = 3.33, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-7.20; OR = 2.59, CI 1.15-5.79 and OR = 2.67, CI 1.14-6.22, respectively).

This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate OT rates in our Level I trauma center using the most recent criteria and guidelines. OT rates during a 12-month period were measured using six definitions based on combinations of Injury Severity Score (ISS), length of hospital stay (LOS, in days), procedures, and disposition after the emergency department. Reason for trauma activation was 55 per cent criteria, 16 per cent guidelines, 11 per cent paramedic judgment, five per cent no reason, and 13 per cent no documentation. OT rates ranged from 22.6 per cent (ISS less than 9, LOS 1 day or less, no consults) to 48.2 per cent (ISS less than 9, LOS 3 days or less, with procedures/consults) and were in compliance with ACS recommendations. Physiologic assessment criteria and anatomic injury had the lowest OT rates and contained all mortalities. Passenger space intrusion (PSI), pedestrian versus automobile (criterion and guideline), and extrication (guideline) all had consistently high rates of OT. We conclude that PSI should be reduced to a guideline, the pedestrian versus automobile criterion and guideline should be combined, and extrication could be removed from the triage scheme.},

METHODS: All trauma entries from May 2010 to Feb 2013 were prospectively reviewed. Calculation of the undertriage and overtriage rates was based on the need for any urgent or life-saving intervention.
RESULTS: We identified 704 trauma patients. Level 1 activations were reduced from 32\% (OLD) to 19\% in the NEW system (P {\textless} .05). Overtriage was reduced from 79\% (OLD) to 44\% in the NEW system (P {\textless} .01). The undertriage rate was 1.6\% in the NEW system, compared with 1.2\% in the OLD system (P = nonsignificant). Of all patients, 14\% (63) required a life-saving intervention. There were no deaths among undertriaged patients.
CONCLUSION: The NEW simplified triage system significantly reduced the rate of overtriage, while safely maintaining a low undertriage rate.},

RESULTS: Overall, 2352 patients met criteria. Nine hundred thirty (39.5\%) with complete hospital records were discharged in {\textless}48 h; 498 (53.5\%) received no procedural intervention and 909 (97.7\%) were ultimately discharged home.
CONCLUSION: Many patients are inappropriately transferred to tertiary care centers without a definitive need for advanced services. Studies are needed to improve triage criteria without increasing under-triage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trauma team activation criteria have a variable performance in the paediatric population. We aimed to identify predictors for high-level resource utilisation during trauma resuscitation in the ED.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the ED of a tertiary paediatric hospital. Patient data were collected from trauma surveillance registry and analysis was performed to identify significant predictors. We then assessed the sensitivity and specificity of proposed models with respect to observed patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 11 282 cases, the mean age was 6.1±4.9 (SD) years old. Fall was the most common mechanism of injury in 7364 (65.3\%) patients. Eighty-eight (0.8\%) patients required at least one high-level resource. Significant predictors for high-resource utilisation were overall GCS of {\textless}14 (relative risk (RR) 38.841, 95\% CI 21.328 to 70.739, p{\textless}0.001), high-risk mechanisms of fall from height and motor vehicle collision (RR 7.863, 95\% CI 4.687 to 13.192, p{\textless}0.001), as well as age-specific tachycardia (RR 1.796, 95\% CI 1.145 to 2.817, p=0.0108). A model consisting of GCS and high-risk mechanism would under-triage 21 (0.2\%) patients and over-triage 681 (6.0\%) patients. When age-specific tachycardia was added, 8 (0.1\%) less patients would be under-triaged but an additional 3251 (28.9\%) patients would be over-triaged.
CONCLUSION: As utilisation of high-level resources in paediatric trauma was rare, it was difficult to find an appropriate balance between under-triage and over-triage. Between the two, minimising the proportion of under-triage is more important as patient safety is paramount in paediatric trauma care.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a TT activation protocol for major trauma patients to predict the need for emergency treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out in the Emergency Department (ED) of a major Italian trauma center. Patients with trauma or burns who accessed the ED in 2015 with a triage red or yellow priority treatment code were included, while pediatric patients were excluded. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were calculated for each TT activation criteria and the aggregated criteria.
RESULTS: Data from 240 patients were collected: 40.42\% of patients had a congruent triage while 50\% were overtriaged and 9.58\% undertriaged. A correct triage led to a lower hospital stay (p {\textless} 0.01), while undertriage was not associated with patients' death (p = 0.16). All criteria had a specificity higher than 95\%, a total sensitivity of 80.83\% and a total positive predictive value of 43.49\%.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that the TT activation criteria had high specificity and sensitivity, while the positive predictive value of the criteria was lower. Mechanisms of injury criteria were less specific and sensitive in detecting the TT activation correctly. As nurses play a pivotal role in the triage of traumatized patients and the TT, reduction of under- and overtriage is essential to improve the patients' health outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2011, revised Field Triage Guidelines were released jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons - Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT). It is unknown how the modifications will affect the number of injured children identified by EMS providers as needing transport to a trauma center.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the change in under- and over-triage rates when the 2011 Field Triage Guidelines are compared to the 2006 and 1999 versions.
METHODS: EMS providers in charge of care for injured children ({\textless}15 years) transported to pediatric trauma centers in 3 mid-sized cities were interviewed immediately after completing transport. Patients were included regardless of injury severity. The interview included patient demographics and each criterion from the Field Triage Guidelines' physiologic status, anatomic injury, and mechanism of injury steps. Included patients were followed through hospital discharge. The 1999, 2006, and 2011 Guidelines were each retrospectively applied to the collected data. Children were considered to have needed a trauma center if they had non-orthopedic surgery within 24 hours, ICU admission, or died. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: EMS interviews were conducted for 5,610 children and outcome data was available for 5,594 (99.7\%). Average age was 7.6 years; 5\% of children were identified as needing a trauma center using the study outcome. Applying the 1999, 2006, or 2011 Guidelines to the EMS interview data the over-triage rate was 32.6\%, 27.9\%, and 28.0\%, respectively. The under-triage rate was 26.5\%, 35.1\%, and 34.8\%, respectively. The 2011 Guidelines resulted in an 8.2\% (95\% CI 0.6-15.9\%) absolute increase in under-triage and a 4.6\% (95\% CI 2.8-6.3\%) decrease in over-triage compared to 1999 Guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Use of the Field Triage Guidelines for children resulted in an unacceptably high rate of under-triage regardless of the version used. Use of the 2011 Guidelines increased under-triage compared to the 1999 version. Research is needed to determine how to better assist EMS providers in identifying children who need the resources of a trauma center.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While out-of-hospital under-triage of seriously injured older adults to tertiary trauma centers has long been acknowledged, no study has adjusted for place of injury or evaluated the extent of inter-facility under-triage. We sought to determine distance and confounder adjusted odds of treatment at a tertiary trauma center (TTC) for older adult trauma patients compared to younger trauma patients, for patients transported from the scene of injury and those transferred from a non-tertiary trauma (NTTC) center.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from a statewide trauma registry reported over a 10-year period (2005-14). The outcome of interest was treatment at an American College of Surgeons or state-designated Level I/II trauma center (TTC). The predictor variable of interest was age group ({\textgreater} = 55 years vs. {\textless} 55 years). Covariates of interest included patient demographics, clinical characteristics and various distance measures calculated based on the patient's injury location.
RESULTS: 84 930 patients met study criteria. Of these 42\% (35659) were 55 years and older with an average age of 74 years (SD, 11.6). Older adult patients were on average, injured slightly farther away from a TTC (median distance, 34 vs. 29 miles, p {\textless} 0.001). Among patients initially presenting to NTTCs, older adults were significantly more likely to be transferred to another NTTC (53\% vs. 34\%). After adjusting for confounders and distance measures, older adults were less likely to be treated at TTCs overall (OR = 0.54, 95\% CI: 0.52-0.56), whether transported by EMS from the scene of injury (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI: 0.44-0.50) or via inter-facility transfer (OR = 0.63, 95\%CI: 0.59-0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: Injured older adults face significant under-triage to TTCs whether by EMS from the scene of injury or via transfer from NTTCs. Adjusting for proximity of injury to a TTC does not alter these findings.},

Adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or lower or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to patients within 3 h of injury. This change was made blind to the trial data, in response to external evidence suggesting that delayed treatment is unlikely to be effective. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury. We prespecified a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 and those with bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN15088122), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01402882), EudraCT (2011-003669-14), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR20121000441277).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12 737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50·3\%] or placebo [6331 [49·7\%], of whom 9202 (72·2\%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury.

Data Sources Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify truncated RCTs up to January 2007; search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects to identify systematic reviews from which individual RCTs were extracted up to January 2008. Study Selection Selected studies were RCTs reported as having stopped early for benefit and matching nontruncated RCTs from systematic reviews. Independent reviewers with medical content expertise, working blinded to trial results, judged the eligibility of the nontruncated RCTs based on their similarity to the truncated RCTs. Data Extraction Reviewers with methodological expertise conducted data extraction independently.
Results The analysis included 91 truncated RCTs asking 63 different questions and 424 matching nontruncated RCTs. The pooled ratio of relative risks in truncated RCTs vs matching nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95\% confidence interval, 0.65-0.77). This difference was independent of the presence of a statistical stopping rule and the methodological quality of the studies as assessed by allocation concealment and blinding. Large differences in treatment effect size between truncated and nontruncated RCTs (ratio of relative risks Ͻ0.75) occurred with truncated RCTs having fewer than 500 events. In 39 of the 63 questions (62\%), the pooled effects of the nontruncated RCTs failed to demonstrate significant benefit.
Conclusions Truncated RCTs were associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped early. This difference was independent of the presence of statistical stopping rules and was greatest in smaller studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation with ECMO support (ECPR) has shown to improve outcome in patients after cardiac arrest under resuscitation. Most current recommendations for ECPR do not include patients with a non-shockable rhythm such as PEA and asystole.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of 3 patient groups separated by initial rhythm at time of ECMO placement during CPR: asystole, PEA and shockable rhythm.
METHODS: We made a retrospective single-center study of adults who underwent ECPR for in-hospital cardiac arrest between June 2008 and January 2017. Outcome and survival were identified in 3 groups of patients regarding to the heart rhythm at the time decision for ECMO support was made: 1. patients with asystole, 2. patients with pulseless electrical activity, 3. patients with a shockable rhythm.
RESULT: 63 patients underwent ECPR in the mentioned time frame. Five patients were excluded due to incomplete data. Under the 58 included patients the number of cases for asystole, PEA, shockable rhythm was 7, 21 and 30 respectively. The means of CPR-time in these groups were 37, 41 and 37min. Survival to discharge was 0.0\%, 23.8\% and 40.0\% respectively (p=0.09). All survivors to discharge had a good neurological outcome, defined as cerebral performance category 1or 2.
CONCLUSION: Survival to discharge in patients with PEA as initial rhythm at the time of decision for ECPR is 23.8\% while no patients with asystole as initial rhythm survived discharge. Patients with PEA should be carefully considered for ECPR.},

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data on all patients who underwent extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) at two academic ECMO referral centres in Sydney, Australia.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients underwent ECPR, 25 (68\%) were for in-hospital cardiac arrests. Median age was 54 (IQR 47-58), 27 (73\%) were male. Initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 20 patients (54\%), pulseless electrical activity (n=14, 38\%), and asystole (n=3, 8\%). 27 (73\%) arrests were witnessed and 30 (81\%) patients received bystander CPR. Median time from arrest to initiation of ECMO flow was 45min (IQR 30-70), and the median time on ECMO was 3days (IQR 1-6). Angiography was performed in 54\% of patients, and 27\% required subsequent coronary intervention (stenting or balloon angioplasty 24\%). A total of 13 patients (35\%) survived to hospital discharge (IHCA 33\% vs. OHCA 37\%). All survivors were discharged with favourable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2). Pre-ECMO lactate level was predictive of mortality OR 1.35 (1.06-1.73, p=0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest, ECPR may provide temporary support as a bridge to intervention or recovery. We report favourable survival and neurological outcomes in one third of patients and pre-ECMO lactate levels predictive of mortality. Further studies are required to determine optimum selection criteria for ECPR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) mortality rates remain very high with poor neurological outcome in survivors. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is one of the treatments of refractory OHCA. This study used data from the mobile intensive care unit (MOICU) as part of the emergency medical system of Paris, and included all consecutive patients treated with ECPR (including pre-hospital ECPR) from 2011 to 2015 for the treatment of refractory OHCA, comparing two historical ECPR management strategies.
METHODS: We consecutively included refractory OHCA patients. In Period 1, ECPR was indicated in selected patients after 30min of advanced life support; in- or pre-hospital implementation depended on estimated transportation time and ECPR team availability. In Period 2, patient care relied on early ECPR initiation after 20min of resuscitation, stringent patient selection, epinephrine dose limitation and deployment of ECPR team with initial response team. Primary outcome was survival with good neurological function Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC score) 1 and 2 at ICU discharge or day 28.
FINDINGS: A total of 156 patients were included. (114 in Period 1 and 42 in Period 2). Baseline characteristics were similar. Mean low-flow duration was shorter by 20min (p{\textless}0.001) in Period 2. Survival was significantly higher in Period 2: 29\% vs 8\% (P{\textless}0.001), as confirmed by the multivariate analysis and propensity score. When combining stringent patient selection with an aggressive strategy, the survival rate increased to 38\%. Pre-hospital ECPR implementation in itself was not an independent predictor of improved survival, but it was part of the strategy in Period 2.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that ECPR in specific settings in the management of refractory OHCA is feasible and can lead to a significant increase in neurological intact survivors. These data, however, need to be confirmed by a large RCT.},

	abstract = {AIM: Estimate prevalence of ECPR-eligible subjects in a large, North American, multi-center cohort, describe natural history with conventional resuscitation, and predict optimal timing of transition to ECPR.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of clinical trial enrolling adults with non-traumatic OHCA. Primary outcome was survival to discharge with favorable outcome (mRS 0-3). Subjects were additionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS 4-5), ROSC without survival (mRS 6), or without ROSC. We plotted subject accrual as a function of resuscitation duration (CPR onset to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or termination of resuscitation), and estimated time-dependent probabilities of ROSC and mRS 0-3 at discharge. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with mRS 0-3.
RESULTS: Of 11,368 subjects, 1237 (10.9\%; 95\%CI 10.3-11.5\%) were eligible for ECPR, Of these, 778 (63\%) achieved ROSC, 466 (38\%) survived to discharge, and 377 (30\%) had mRS 0-3 at discharge. Half with eventual mRS 0-3 achieved ROSC within 8.8min (95\%CI 8.3-9.2min) of resuscitation, and 90\% within 21.0min (95\%CI 19.1-23.7min). Time-dependent probabilities of ROSC and mRS 0-3 declined over elapsed resuscitation, and the likelihood of additional cases with mRS 0-3 beyond 20min was 8.4\% (95\%CI 5.9-11.0\%). Resuscitation duration was independently associated with survival to discharge with mRS 0-3 (OR 0.95; 95\%CI 0.92-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Approximately 11\% of subjects were eligible for ECPR. Only one-third survived to discharge with favorable outcome. Performing 9-21min of conventional resuscitation captured most ECPR-eligible subjects with eventual mRS 0-3 at hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syncope is a common chief complaint among older adults in the Emergency Department (ED), and orthostatic vital signs are often a part of their evaluation. We assessed whether abnormal orthostatic vital signs in the ED are associated with composite 30-day serious outcomes in older adults presenting with syncope.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study at 11 EDs in adults ≥ 60 years who presented with syncope or near syncope. We excluded patients lost to follow up. We used the standard definition of abnormal orthostatic vital signs or subjective symptoms of lightheadedness upon standing to define orthostasis. We determined the rate of composite 30-day serious outcomes, including those during the index ED visit, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiac intervention, new diagnosis of structural heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hemorrhage/anemia requiring transfusion, with major traumatic injury from fall, recurrent syncope, and death) between the groups with normal and abnormal orthostatic vital signs.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 1974 patients, of whom 51.2\% were male and 725 patients (37.7\%) had abnormal orthostatic vital signs. Comparing those with abnormal to those with normal orthostatic vital signs, we did not find a difference in composite 30-serious outcomes (111/725 (15.3\%) vs 184/1249 (14.7\%); unadjusted odds ratio, 1.05 [95\%CI, 0.81-1.35], p = 0.73). After adjustment for gender, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), history of arrhythmia, dyspnea, hypotension, any abnormal ECG, physician risk assessment, medication classes and disposition, there was no association with composite 30-serious outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95\%CI, 0.62-1.09], p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of older adult patients presenting with syncope who were able to have orthostatic vital signs evaluated, abnormal orthostatic vital signs did not independently predict composite 30-day serious outcomes.},

The study included all children aged 15 years or younger who were intubated in the prehospital setting by King County paramedics from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 1990. \textbf{Results:} During the 7-year study period, 654 children were intubated, of which 355 (54\%) were study patients. The median age of the patients was 3 years; 60\% had an injury diagnosis. On arrival of the paramedics, 60\% of the patients were in sinus rhythm, 62\% had a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg or greater, and 56\% had a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute or greater. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 8 or lower in 83\% of the patients. Succinylcholine was used to facilitate intubation in 47\% of patients. On arrival at the emergency department, 79\% of the patients were in sinus rhythm; 75\% had an adequate blood pressure (70 mm Hg or greater); 86\% had a PaO $_{\textrm{2}}$ value of 100 mm Hg or greater; and 74\% had a PaCO $_{\textrm{2}}$ value of 45 mm Hg or lower. Complications of intubation, more than half of which were classified as minor, were noted in 22.6\% of patients. We were unable to determine the number of failed intubation attempts. Most of the patients (58\%) survived to hospital discharge. Among cardiac arrest victims, only 12\% survived. \textbf{Conclusion:} In a setting where paramedics practice with close medical direction, applying liberal indications for pediatric intubation and permitting the use of succinylcholine allowed paramedics to intubate children of different ages and diagnoses.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergency medical services (EMS) providers infrequently encounter seriously ill and injured pediatric patients. Clinical simulations are useful for assessing skill level, especially for low-frequency, high-risk problems.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the most common performance deficiencies in paramedics' management of three simulated pediatric emergencies.
METHODS: Paramedics from five EMS agencies in Michigan were eligible subjects for this prospective, observational study. Three clinical assessment modules (CAMs) were designed and validated using pediatric simulators with varying technologic complexity. Scenarios included an infant cardiopulmonary arrest, sepsis/seizure, and child asthma/respiratory arrest. Each scenario required paramedics to perform an assessment and provide appropriate pediatric patient care within a 12-minute time limit. Trained instructors conducted the simulations by following strict guidelines for sequences of events and responses. Videos of CAMs were reviewed by an independent evaluator to verify scoring accuracy. Percentage of steps completed for each of the three scenarios and specific performance deficiencies were recorded.
RESULTS: Two hundred twelve paramedics completed the CAMs. The average percentages of steps completed were as follows: arrest CAM, 45.3\%; asthma CAM, 51.6\%; and sepsis CAM, 47.1\%. Performance deficiencies included lack of airway support or protection; lack of support of ventilations or cardiac function; inappropriate use of length-based treatment tapes; and inaccurate calculation and administration of medications and fluids.
CONCLUSION: Multiple deficiencies in paramedics' performance of pediatric resuscitation skills were objectively identified using three manikin-based simulations. EMS educators and EMS medical directors should target these specific skill deficiencies when developing continuing education in prehospital pediatric patient care.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The objectives were to determine the effect of pediatric airway management training on paramedic self-efficacy and skill performance and to determine which of several retraining methods is superior. Methods: A total of 2,520 paramedics were trained to proficiency in pediatric bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and endotracheal intubation (ETI) on mannequins. Subjects were a convenience sample of 245 (10\% of original cohort) presenting for voluntary retraining. A total of 212 of 245 (87\%) completed skills testing. Self-efficacy was measured prior to and following initial training and retraining events. Paramedics were assigned to control (no retraining), videotape presentation, self-directed learning, or instructor-facilitated lecture and demonstration retraining. Following retraining, BMV and ETI skills were tested. Results: Paramedics from low-call-volume areas reported lower baseline self-efficacy and derived larger increases with training, but also experienced the most decline between training events. Pass rates for BMV and ETI were 66\% (139/211) and 42\% (88/212), respectively. However, overall cohort self-efficacy was maintained over the study period. In ordinal regression modeling, only the lecture and demonstration method was superior to control, with an odds ratio (OR) of achieving higher scores of 2.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2 to 5.2) for BMV and 5.2 (95\% CI = 2.4 to 11.2) for ETI. Poor performance with ETI but not BMV was associated with time elapsed since training (p = 0.01). Self-efficacy ratings were not predictive of skill performance. Conclusions: Training provides increases in self-efficacy, particularly among paramedics from low-call-volume areas. A gap exists between self-efficacy and skill performance, in that self-efficacy may be maintained even when skill performance declines. Pediatric airway skills decay quickly, ETI skills drop off more significantly than BMV skills, and a lecture and demonstration format seems superior to other retraining methods investigated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proficiency in endotracheal intubation (ETI) is assumed to improve primarily with accumulated experience on live patients. While the National Standard Paramedic Curriculum recommends that paramedic students (PSs) perform at least five live ETIs, these training opportunities are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of cumulative live ETI experience, elapsed duration of training, and clinical setting on PS ETI proficiency.
METHODS: The authors used longitudinal, multicenter data from 60 paramedic training programs over a two-year period. The PSs reported outcomes (success/failure) for all live ETIs attempted in the operating room (OR), the emergency department (ED), the intensive care unit (ICU), and other hospital or prehospital settings. Fixed-effects logistic regression was used to model up to 30 consecutive ETI efforts by each PS, accounting for per-PS clustering. For each patient, the authors evaluated the association between ETI success and the PS's cumulative number of ETIs, adjusted for clinical setting, elapsed number of days from the first ETI encounter, and the interaction (cumulative ETIs x elapsed days). Predicted probability plots were constructed depicting the "learning curve" overall and for each clinical setting. Results. Between one and 74 ETIs (median 7; IQR 4-12) were performed by each of 802 PSs. Of 7,635 ETIs, 6,464 (87.4\%) were successful. Stratified by clinical setting, 6,311 (82.7\%) ETIs were performed in the OR, 271 (3.6\%) in the ED, 64 (0.8\%) in the ICU, 86 (1.1\%) in other in-hospital settings, and 903 (11.8\%) in the prehospital setting. For the 7,398 ETIs included in the multivariate analysis, cumulative number of ETI was associated with increased adjusted odds of ETI success (odds ratio 1.067 per ETI; 95\% CI: 1.044-1.091). ETI learning curves were steepest for the ICU and prehospital settings but lower than for other clinical settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Paramedic student ETI success improves with accumulated live experience but appears to vary across different clinical settings. Strategies for PS airway education must consider the volume of live ETIs as well as the clinical settings used for ETI training.},

	abstract = {Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of EMS responses between 2006 and 2012 that involved attempted intubation of children younger than 13 years by paramedics in a large, metropolitan EMS system. We calculated the incidence rate of attempted pediatric intubation with EMS and county census data. To summarize the intubation process, we linked a detailed out-of-hospital airway registry with clinical records from EMS, hospital, or autopsy encounters for each child. The main outcome measures were procedural challenges, procedural success, complications, and patient disposition.
Results: Paramedics attempted intubation in 299 cases during 6.3 years, with an incidence of 1 pediatric intubation per 2,198 EMS responses. Less than half of intubations (44\%) were for patients in cardiac arrest. Two thirds of patients were intubated on the ﬁrst attempt (66\%), and overall success was 97\%. The most prevalent challenge was body ﬂuids obscuring the laryngeal view (33\%). After a failed ﬁrst intubation attempt, corrective actions taken by paramedics included changing equipment (33\%), suctioning (32\%), and repositioning the patient (27\%). Six patients (2\%) experienced peri-intubation cardiac arrest and 1 patient had an iatrogenic tracheal injury. No esophageal intubations were observed. Of patients transported to the hospital, 86\% were admitted to intensive care and hospital mortality was 27\%.
Conclusion: Pediatric intubation by paramedics was performed infrequently in this EMS system. Although overall intubation success was high, a detailed evaluation of the process of intubation revealed speciﬁc challenges and adjustments that can be anticipated by paramedics to improve ﬁrst-pass success, potentially reduce complications, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Stop Stroke (Pulsara; Bozeman, Montana USA) medical application on door-to-needle (DTN) time in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the Good Shepherd Health System (Longview, Texas USA) stroke quality improvement dashboard for a 25-month period from February 2012 through February 2014. Data analysis includes all data from Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Baltimore, Maryland USA) reportable cases receiving Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) for AIS during the study period. The primary outcome was mean DTN times before and after initiating Stop Stroke. Secondary outcome was the effect on the DTN≤60-minute benchmark.
RESULTS: During the study period, there were 533 stroke activations (200 before Stop Stroke implementation and 333 after). A total of 68 patients meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed (34 pre-app and 34 post- app). The observed mean DTN times post-app decreased 21 minutes (77 to 56 minutes), a 28\% improvement (P=.001). Further, the patients meeting DTN≤60 minutes improved from 32\% (11 of 34) to 82\% (28 of 34) after the app's implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with AIS, Stop Stroke improved mean DTN times and number of patients treated within 60 minutes of arrival. These results demonstrate the app's effect of increasing awareness of suspected AIS and improving coordination of care, evidenced by the magnitude of its effect on treatment times.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of the STOP STEMI© medical application on door-to-balloon (D2B) time in patients arriving to our emergency department with an acute ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). STOP STEMI© is a novel medical application developed by physicians to improve the coordination and communication tasks essential to rapid assessment and care of the patients suffering from a STEMI.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective before and after review of the Good Shepherd Health System STEMI quality assurance/improvement dashboard for a 10-month period between November, 2012 and September, 2013 (4 months before STOP STEMI© and 6 months after). Data was collected using a standard data collection form and entered on the dashboard by a STEMI coordinator blinded to study objectives. We calculated the average D2B times before and after initiation of STOP STEMI© along with the improvement in the benchmarks of D2B less than 90 min and D2B less than 60 minutes. A subgroup analysis of Center for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS) reportable cases was conducted to evaluate these benchmarks in the subset of patients meeting the criteria for CMS reporting by our facility.
RESULTS: During the study period, we received 155 STEMI patients, average 0.5 patients per day. One hundred twelve of the patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 37 preSTOP STEMI©, and 75 postSTOP STEMI©. Of the 112 PCI cases, 7 were excluded leaving 105 cases for analysis, 36 preapplication and 69 postapplication. We found a 22\% reduction in the average door-to-balloon time after implementing the STOP STEMI© application (91-71 minutes) respectively, the average difference of 20 minutes P = 0.05 (95\% CI, -1-40minutes). In the analysis of CMS reportable cases (n = 64 cases), we observed a decrease in the average D2B of 15 minutes (68-53 minutes), a 22\% reduction P = 0.03 (95\% CI 1-29min). In the CMS reportable cases, we saw an improvement in the D2B time less than 90 minutes from 78-95\% and less than 60 minutes D2B improvement from 56-80\%. We also observed an appropriate absolute reduction in PCI resource utilization by 11\%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, the utilization of STOP STEMI© decreased the average door-to-balloon times by 22\% in the patients with acute STEMI arriving at our emergency department. This effect was maintained when looking at the subset of all STEMI cases reportable to CMS. We also observed modest improvements in meeting the less than 60-minute, less than 90-minute benchmarks, and improvements in the resource utilization.},

	abstract = {The information that emergency medical technicians (EMTs) collect at the incident site is typically communicated verbally to the emergency department (ED) prior to arrival. However, communication by verbal channels can introduce lags, is limited by human recall and attention, is repetitious, and often lacks consistent and sufficient detail. To fill this gap, the work herein describes the design of a mobile data entry system for EMTs and a desktop-based data display and messaging system for charge nurses in the ED. With the system, EMTs can enter the case type, patient details, assessment, vitals, and treatments. After the EMT sends the report, the charge nurse can accept the patient, assign a room and resources, and further message with the EMT. Design choices were based upon stakeholder analysis. Since the data and data entry required of the EMTs can be extensive, non-sequential, partially available, and case dependent, the app was designed to avoid open-field typing, employ a compact navigational strategy, dynamically generate fields adapted to the medical scenario, and switch between editing and reviewing a report in context. The design was implemented into an interactive wireframe for testing on smart phones. Usability evaluation was performed via heuristic evaluation and user scenario testing with EMTs. On average, users could complete a typical, time-sensitive case in 66 seconds, which is near theoretical estimates and current means of verbal communication now done via phone and radio.},

	abstract = {Emergency medical service (EMS) systems are public services that provide quick response, transportation as well as appropriate emergency medical care to the emergent patient. For EMS, every second is critical. Unfortunately, current EMS systems have many challenges: lack effective communication between EMS providers and hospital professionals, less attention on care quality and limited resources of medical equipment and personnel. Motivated by this, in this paper, we explore the use of wearable sensing, smart mobile device as well as video technology to propose STREMS: an efficient smart real-time prehospital communication system for EMS. Specifically, we first introduce a cost-effective wearable physiological sensing solution to support multi-dimensional telemetry monitoring for an ambulance operating at as Basic Life Support, a type of EMS service level without sophisticated medical equipment or paramedics. Then we propose to build a cloud-based real-time data sharing platform, enabling automated streaming all gathered prehospital data (e.g., vital signs, EKG and image/short videos about accident scene) to the hospital prior to ambulance arrival, thus giving a more complete figure about the incoming patient. This can significantly decrease the handoff time and improve the efficiency at the hospital. Additionally, a live point to point video communication is proposed to support EMS telemedicine to enhance prehospital care quality through directly video conversation to assist EMS providers in consultation, triage, early medical examination and treatment. We implemented STREMS as an Android mobile app and evaluated its feasibility over the broadband cellular network in the city of Detroit. In a moving context, our results demonstrate STREMS can successfully deliver 100\% of emergency data to the hospital in less than 1.5s, on average 0.75s for reporting a new case and 0.05s for health data. As the live video with 1280×720 pixel resolution, STREMS only works when the vehicle speed is less than 40MPH.},

	abstract = {Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is expected to improve the neurological outcomes of patients with refractory cardiac arrest; however, it is invasive, expensive, and requires substantial human resources. The ability to predict neurological outcomes would assist in patient selection for ECPR.To develop and validate a prediction model for neurological outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm treated with ECPR.This prognostic study analyzed data from the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest registry, a multi-institutional nationwide cohort study that included 87 emergency departments in Japan. All adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shockable rhythm who were treated with ECPR between June 2014 and December 2017 were included. Patients were randomly assigned to the development and validation cohorts based on the institutions. The analysis was conducted between November 2019 and August 2020.Age (\&lt;65 years), time from call to hospital arrival (≤25 minutes), initial cardiac rhythm on hospital arrival (shockable), and initial pH value (≥7.0).The primary outcome was 1-month survival with favorable neurological outcome, defined by Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2. In the development cohort, a simple scoring system was developed to predict this outcome using a logistic regression model. The diagnostic ability and calibration of the scoring system were assessed in the validation cohort.A total of 916 patients were included, 458 in the development cohort (median [interquartile range \{IQR\}] age, 61 [47-69] years, 377 [82.3\%] men) and 458 in the validation cohort (median [IQR] age, 60 [49-68] years; 393 [85.8\%] men). The cohorts had the same proportion of favorable neurological outcome (57 patients [12.4\%]). The prediction scoring system was developed, attributing a score of 1 for each clinical predictor. Patients were divided into 4 groups, corresponding to their scores on the prediction model, as follows: very low probability (score 0), low probability (score 1), middle probability (score 2), and high probability (score 3-4) of good neurological outcome. The mean predicted probabilities in the groups stratified by score were as follows: very low, 1.6\% (95\% CI, 1.6\%-1.6\%); low, 4.4\% (95\% CI, 4.2\%-4.6\%); middle, 12.5\% (95\% CI, 12.1\%-12.8\%); and high, 30.8\% (95\% CI, 29.1\%-32.5\%). In the validation cohort, the C statistic of the scoring system was 0.724 (95\% CI, 0.652-0.786). The predicted probability was evaluated as well calibrated to the observed favorable outcome in both cohorts by visual assessment of the calibration plot.In this study, the scoring system had good discrimination and calibration performance to predict favorable neurological outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shockable rhythm who were treated with ECPR.},

	abstract = {Objective  To describe characteristics of patients admitted with refractory cardiac arrest for possible extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) and gain insight into the reasons for refraining from treatment in some.
Methods  Nationwide retrospective cohort study involving all tertiary centres providing ECPR in Denmark. Consecutive patients admitted with ongoing chest compression for evaluation for ECPR treatment were enrolled. Presenting characteristics, duration of no-­flow and low-­flow time, end-­tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), lactate and pH, and recording of reasons for refraining from ECPR documented by the treating team were recorded. Outcomes were survival to intensive care unit admission and survival to hospital discharge.
Results  Of 579 patients admitted with refractory cardiac arrest for possible ECPR, 221 patients (38\%) proceeded to ECPR and 358 patients (62\%) were not considered candidates. Median prehospital low-­flow time was 70 min (IQR 56 to 85) in ECPR patients and 62 min (48 to 81) in no-­ECPR patients, p{\textless}0.001. Intra-­arrest transport was more than 50 km in 92 (42\%) ECPR patients and 135 in no-­ECPR patients (38\%), p=0.25. The leading causes for not initiating ECPR stated by the treating team were duration of low-­flow time in 39\%, severe metabolic derangement in 35\%, and in 31\% low ETCO2. The prevailing combination of contributing factors were non-­shockable rhythm, low ETCO2, and metabolic derangement or prehospital low-­flow time combined with low ETCO2. Survival to discharge was only achieved in six patients (1.7\%) in the no-­ECPR group.
Conclusions  In this large nationwide study of patients admitted for possible ECPR, two-­thirds of patients were not treated with ECPR. The most frequent reasons to abstain from ECPR were long duration of prehospital low-­flow time, metabolic derangement and low ETCO2.},

However, over recent decades, there has been a steady increase in the number of research studies that are using machine learning (ML) to read or interrogate ECG data.
Objective
The aim of this study is to review the use of ML with ECG data using a time series approach.
Methods
Papers that address the subject of ML and the ECG were identified by systematically searching databases that archive papers from January 1995 to October 2019. Time series analysis was used to study the changing popularity of the different types of ML algorithms that have been used with ECG data over the past two decades. Finally, a meta-analysis of how various ML techniques performed for various diagnostic classifications was also undertaken.
Results
A total of 757 papers was identified. Based on results, the use of ML with ECG data started to increase sharply (p {\textless} 0.001) from 2012. Healthcare applications, especially in heart abnormality classification, were the most common application of ML when using ECG data (p {\textless} 0.001). However, many new emerging applications include using ML and the ECG for biometrics and driver drowsiness. The support vector machine was the technique of choice for a decade. However, since 2018, deep learning has been trending upwards and is likely to be the leading technique in the coming few years. Despite the accuracy paradox, accuracy was the most frequently used metric in the studies reviewed, followed by sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and then AUC.
Conclusion
Applying ML using ECG data has shown promise. Data scientists and physicians should collaborate to ensure that clinical knowledge is being applied appropriately and is informing the design of ML algorithms. Data scientists also need to consider knowledge guided feature engineering and the explicability of the ML algorithm as well as being transparent in the algorithm's performance to appropriately calibrate human-AI trust. Future work is required to enhance ML performance in ECG classification.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool for the detection of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, machine learning (ML) for the diagnosis of STEMI complicated with arrhythmia and infarct-related arteries is still underdeveloped based on real-world data. Therefore, we aimed to develop an ML model using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to automatically diagnose acute STEMI based on ECG features. A total of 318 patients with STEMI and 502 control subjects were enrolled from Jan 2017 to Jun 2019. Coronary angiography was performed. A total of 180 automatic ECG features of 12-lead ECG were input into the model. The LASSO regression model was trained and validated by the internal training dataset and tested by the internal and external testing datasets. A comparative test was performed between the LASSO regression model and different levels of doctors. To identify the STEMI and non-STEMI, the LASSO model retained 14 variables with AUCs of 0.94 and 0.93 in the internal and external testing datasets, respectively. The performance of LASSO regression was similar to that of experienced cardiologists (AUC: 0.92) but superior (p {\textless} 0.05) to internal medicine residents, medical interns, and emergency physicians. Furthermore, in terms of identifying left anterior descending (LAD) or non-LAD, LASSO regression achieved AUCs of 0.92 and 0.98 in the internal and external testing datasets, respectively. This LASSO regression model can achieve high accuracy in diagnosing STEMI and LAD vessel disease, thus providing an assisting diagnostic tool based on ECG, which may improve the early diagnosis of STEMI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide an updated systematic review on the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) compared with manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation during cardiac arrest.
METHODS: This was an update of a systematic review published in 2018. OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized trials and observational studies between January 1, 2018, and June 21, 2022. The population included adults and children with out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed bias. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.
RESULTS: The search identified 3 trials, 27 observational studies, and 6 cost-effectiveness studies. All trials included adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were terminated before enrolling the intended number of subjects. One trial found a benefit of ECPR in survival and favorable neurological status, whereas two trials found no statistically significant differences in outcomes. There were 23 observational studies in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in combination with in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 4 observational studies in children with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Results of individual studies were inconsistent, although many studies favored ECPR. The risk of bias was intermediate for trials and critical for observational studies. The certainty of evidence was very low to low. Study heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness varied depending on the setting and the analysis assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent randomized trials suggest potential benefit of ECPR, but the certainty of evidence remains low. It is unclear which patients might benefit from ECPR.},

The annual number of DALY because of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States is unknown. Our objective was to estimate the DALY after adult nontraumatic, emergency medical services-treated OHCA, and to compare OHCA DALY to other leading causes of death and disability in the US. Methods and Results The DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. The years of life lost were calculated using all adult nontraumatic emergency medical services-treated OHCA with complete data from the national Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database for 2016, and actuarial data for remaining life expectancy at the age of death. Cerebral performance category scores from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database and previously established disability weights were used to estimate years lived with disability. The cohort's calculated DALY were extrapolated to a national level to estimate total US DALY. Data were reported as total, mean, and DALY per 100 000 individuals. A total of 59 752 OHCA met study inclusion criteria. The DALY for the study population were 1 194 993 (years of life lost, 1 194 069; years lived with disability, 924) in 2016. The estimated total DALY following adult nontraumatic emergency medical services-treated OHCA in the US were 4 354  192 (years of life lost, 4 350  825; years lived with disability, 3365) for the index year 2016. The rate of OHCA DALY were 1347 per 100 000 population, which ranked third in the US behind ischemic heart disease (2447) and low back and neck pain (1565). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings. Conclusions Adult nontraumatic OHCA is a leading cause of annual DALY in the US and should be a focus of public health policy and resources.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual and lifetime economic productivity loss due to adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States (U.S.).
METHODS: All adult (age ≥ 18 years) non-traumatic EMS-treated OHCA with complete data for age, sex, race, and survival outcomes from the CARES database for 2013-2018 were included. Annual and lifetime labor productivity values, based on age and gender, were obtained from previously published national economic data. Productivity losses for OHCA events were calculated by year in U.S. dollars. Productivity losses for survivors were assigned by cerebral performance category score (CPC): CPC 1 and 2 = 0\% productivity loss; CPC 3-5 = 100\% productivity loss. Sensitivity analyses were performed assigning CPC 2 varying productivity losses (0-100\%) based on CPC score and discharge location. Lifetime productivity values assumed 1\% annual growth and 3\% discount rate and were adjusted for inflation based on 2016 values. Results were extrapolated to annual U.S. population estimates for the study period.
RESULTS: A total of 338,492 (96.5\%) cases met inclusion criteria. The mean annual and lifetime productivity losses per OHCA in 2018 were \$48,224 and \$638,947 respectively. The total annual economic productivity loss due to OHCA in the U.S. increased from \$7.4B in 2013 to \$11.3B in 2018. Lifetime economic productivity loss increased from \$95.2B in 2013 to \$150.2B in 2018. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings. Per annual death, OHCA ranked third (\$10.2B) in annual economic productivity loss in the U.S. behind cancer (\$22.9B) and heart disease (\$20.3B) in 2018.
CONCLUSION: Adult non-traumatic OHCA events are associated with significant annual and lifetime economic productivity losses and should be the focus of public health resources to improve preventative measures and survival outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild therapeutic hypothermia (TH), or targeted temperature management, improves survival and neurological outcomes in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). International guidelines strongly support initiating TH for all eligible individuals presenting with OHCA; however, the timing of cooling initiation remains uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with all available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included to explore the efficacy and safety of initiating pre-hospital TH in patients with OHCA.
METHODS: The MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to October 2017. Inclusion criteria for full-text review included RCTs comparing pre-hospital TH with no pre-hospital TH after cardiac arrest, patients {\textgreater} 14 years of age with documented cardiac arrest from any rhythm, and outcome data that included survival to hospital discharge and temperature at hospital arrival. Results of retrieved studies were compared through meta-analysis using random effects modelling.
RESULTS: A total of 10 trials comprising 4220 patients were included. There were no significant differences between the two arms for the primary outcome of neurological recovery (risk ratio [RR] 1.04, 95\% CI 0.93-1.15) or the secondary outcome of survival to hospital discharge (RR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.92-1.11). However, there was a significantly lower temperature at hospital arrival in patients receiving pre-hospital TH (mean difference - 0.83, 95\% CI - 1.03 to - 0.63). Pre-hospital TH significantly increased the risk of re-arrest (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.41). No survival differences were observed among subgroups of patients who received intra-arrest TH vs post-arrest TH or who had shockable vs non-shockable rhythms.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-hospital TH after OHCA effectively decreases body temperature at the time of hospital arrival. However, it does not improve rates of survival with good neurological outcome or overall survival and is associated with increased rates of re-arrest.},

	abstract = {Hospital cooling improves outcome after cardiac arrest, but prehospital cooling immediately after return of spontaneous circulation may result in better outcomes.To determine whether prehospital cooling improves outcomes after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and without VF.A randomized clinical trial that assigned adults with prehospital cardiac arrest to standard care with or without prehospital cooling, accomplished by infusing up to 2 L of 4°C normal saline as soon as possible following return of spontaneous circulation. Adults in King County, Washington, with prehospital cardiac arrest and resuscitated by paramedics were eligible and 1359 patients (583 with VF and 776 without VF) were randomized between December 15, 2007, and December 7, 2012. Patient follow-up was completed by May 1, 2013. Nearly all of the patients resuscitated from VF and admitted to the hospital received hospital cooling regardless of their randomization.The primary outcomes were survival to hospital discharge and neurological status at discharge.The intervention decreased mean core temperature by 1.20°C (95\% CI, −1.33°C to −1.07°C) in patients with VF and by 1.30°C (95\% CI, −1.40°C to −1.20°C) in patients without VF by hospital arrival and reduced the time to achieve a temperature of less than 34°C by about 1 hour compared with the control group. However, survival to hospital discharge was similar among the intervention and control groups among patients with VF (62.7\% [95\% CI, 57.0\%-68.0\%] vs 64.3\% [95\% CI, 58.6\%-69.5\%], respectively; P = .69) and among patients without VF (19.2\% [95\% CI, 15.6\%-23.4\%] vs 16.3\% [95\% CI, 12.9\%-20.4\%], respectively; P = .30). The intervention was also not associated with improved neurological status of full recovery or mild impairment at discharge for either patients with VF (57.5\% [95\% CI, 51.8\%-63.1\%] of cases had full recovery or mild impairment vs 61.9\% [95\% CI, 56.2\%-67.2\%] of controls; P = .69) or those without VF (14.4\% [95\% CI, 11.3\%-18.2\%] of cases vs 13.4\% [95\% CI,10.4\%-17.2\%] of controls; P = .30). Overall, the intervention group experienced rearrest in the field more than the control group (26\% [95\% CI, 22\%-29\%] vs 21\% [95\% CI, 18\%-24\%], respectively; P = .008), as well as increased diuretic use and pulmonary edema on first chest x-ray, which resolved within 24 hours after admission.Although use of prehospital cooling reduced core temperature by hospital arrival and reduced the time to reach a temperature of 34°C, it did not improve survival or neurological status among patients resuscitated from prehospital VF or those without VF.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00391469},

	abstract = {Purpose
Mild therapeutic hypothermia proved to be beneficial when induced after cardiac arrest in humans. Prehospital cooling with i.v. fluids was associated with adverse side effects. Our primary objective was to compare time to target temperature of out-of hospital cardiac arrest patients cooled non-invasively either in the prehospital setting vs. the in-hospital (IH) setting, to assess surface-cooling safety profile and long term outcome.
Methods
In this retrospective, single center cohort study, a group of adult patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after out-of hospital cardiac arrest were cooled with a surface cooling pad beginning either in the prehospital or IH setting for 24h. Time to target temperature (33.9°C), temperature on admission, time to admission after ROSC and outcome were compared. Also, rearrests and pulmonary edema were assessed. Neurologic outcome at 12 months was evaluated (Cerebral Performance Category, CPC 1–2, favorable outcome).
Results
Between September 2005 and February 2010, 56 prehospital cooled patients and 54 IH-cooled patients were treated. Target temperature was reached in 85 (66–117)min (prehospital) and in 135 (102–192)min (IH) after ROSC (p{\textless}0.001). After prehospital cooling, hospital admission temperature was 35.2 (34.2–35.8)°C, and in the IH-cooling patients initial temperature was 35.8 (35.2–36.3)°C (p=0.001). No difference in numbers of rearrests and pulmonary edema between groups was observed. In both groups, no skin lesions were observed. Favorable outcome was reached in 26.8\% (prehospital) and in 37.0\% (IH) of the patients (p=0.17).
Conclusions
Using a non-invasive prehospital surface cooling method after cardiac arrest, target temperature can be reached faster without any major complications than starting cooling IH. The effect of early non-invasive cooling on long-term outcome remains to be determined in larger studies.},

	abstract = {Background:

Patients successfully resuscitated by paramedics from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest often have severe neurologic injury. Laboratory and observational clinical reports have suggested that induction of therapeutic hypothermia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may improve neurologic outcomes. One technique for induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia during CPR is a rapid infusion of large-volume cold crystalloid fluid.

Methods:

In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial we assigned adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest undergoing CPR to either a rapid intravenous infusion of up to 2 L of cold saline or standard care. The primary outcome measure was survival at hospital discharge; secondary end points included return of a spontaneous circulation. The trial was closed early (at 48\% recruitment target) due to changes in temperature management at major receiving hospitals.

Results:

A total of 1198 patients were assigned to either therapeutic hypothermia during CPR (618 patients) or standard prehospital care (580 patients). Patients allocated to therapeutic hypothermia received a mean (SD) of 1193 (647) mL cold saline. For patients with an initial shockable cardiac rhythm, there was a decrease in the rate of return of a spontaneous circulation in patients who received cold saline compared with standard care (41.2\% compared with 50.6\%, P=0.03). Overall 10.2\% of patients allocated to therapeutic hypothermia during CPR were alive at hospital discharge compared with 11.4\% who received standard care (P=0.71).

Conclusions:

In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia using a rapid infusion of large-volume, intravenous cold saline during CPR may decrease the rate of return of a spontaneous circulation in patients with an initial shockable rhythm and produced no trend toward improved outcomes at hospital discharge.

	abstract = {Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched on June 17, 2021 for clinical trials. The population included adult patients with cardiac arrest. The review included all aspects of targeted temperature management including timing, temperature, duration, method of induction and maintenance, and rewarming. Two investigators reviewed trials for relevance, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.
Results: The systematic search identiﬁed 32 trials. Risk of bias was assessed as intermediate for most of the outcomes. For targeted temperature management with a target of 32–34 °C vs. normothermia (which often required active cooling), 9 trials were identiﬁed, with six trials included in metaanalyses. Targeted temperature management with a target of 32–34 °C did not result in an improvement in survival (risk ratio: 1.08 [95\%CI: 0.89, 1.30]) or favorable neurologic outcome (risk ratio: 1.21 [95\%CI: 0.91, 1.61]) at 90 to 180 days after the cardiac arrest (low certainty of evidence). Three trials assessed different hypothermic temperature targets and found no difference in outcomes (low certainty of evidence). Ten trials were identiﬁed comparing prehospital cooling vs. no prehospital cooling with no improvement in survival (risk ratio: 1.01 [95\%CI: 0.92, 1.11]) or favorable neurologic outcome (risk ratio: 1.00 [95\%CI: 0.90, 1.11]) at hospital discharge (moderate certainty of evidence).
Conclusions: Among adult patients with cardiac arrest, the use of targeted temperature management at 32–34 °C, when compared to normothermia, did not result in improved outcomes in this meta-analysis. There was no effect of initiating targeted temperature management prior to hospital arrival. These ﬁndings warrant an update of international cardiac arrest guidelines.},

	abstract = {For more than a decade, mild induced hypothermia (32°C–34°C) has been standard of care for patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, and this has been extrapolated to survivors of cardiac arrest with initially nonshockable rhythms and to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two randomized trials published in 2002 reported a survival and neurological benefit with mild induced hypothermia. One recent randomized trial reported similar outcomes in patients treated with targeted temperature management at either 33°C or 36°C. In response to these new data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Advanced Life Support Task Force performed a systematic review to evaluate 3 key questions: (1) Should mild induced hypothermia (or some form of targeted temperature management) be used in comatose post–cardiac arrest patients? (2) If used, what is the ideal timing of the intervention? (3) If used, what is the ideal duration of the intervention? The task force used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess and summarize the evidence and to provide a consensus on science statement and treatment recommendations. The task force recommends targeted temperature management for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm at a constant temperature between 32°C and 36°C for at least 24 hours. Similar suggestions are made for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. The task force recommends against prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluid. Additional and specific recommendations are provided in the document.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the performance of a regional system with prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) identification of STEMI patients and direct paramedic transport to STEMI receiving centers (SRCs) for provision of primary PCI.
METHODS: This was a prospective study evaluating the first year of implementation of a regional SRC network to determine the key time intervals for patients identified with STEMI in the prehospital setting. Results. During the 12-month study period, 1,220 patients with a suspected STEMI were identified on prehospital 12-lead ECG, of whom 734 (60\%) underwent emergency PCI. A door-to-balloon time of 90 minutes or less was achieved for 651 (89\%) patients, and 459 (62.5\%) had EMS-patient contact-to-balloon times {\textless}or= 90 minutes. Transport of suspected STEMI patients to an SRC resulted in ambulance diversion from a closer ED for 31\% of patients and a median increase in transport time of 3.8 minutes.
CONCLUSION: Door-to-balloon times within the 90-minute benchmark were achieved for almost 90\% of STEMI patients transported by paramedics after implementing our regionalized SRC system.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The best location for safe and timely implementation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is currently uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the association between the location of ECPR and survival outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. We also evaluated whether the effects of ECPR location on survival differed between patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) and those who did not.
METHODS: We used data collected between 2013 and 2020 from a nationwide OHCA database. Adult OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology who underwent ECPR were included in the study. The primary outcome was survival to discharge. The main exposure was the ECPR location (emergency department [ED] or cardiac catheterization laboratory [Cath lab]). We compared primary outcomes of ECPR between the ED and Cath lab using multivariable logistic regression. The interaction between ECPR location and CAG was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 564 ECPR patients, 448 (79.4\%) and 116 (20.6\%) underwent ECPR in the ED and Cath lab, respectively. CAG was observed in 52.5\% and 72.4\% of the patients in the ED and Cath lab groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in survival to discharge between the ED and Cath lab groups (14.1\% vs. 12.9\%, p = 0.75, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95\% confidence interval] 1.87 [0.85-4.11]). AOR of interaction analysis (95\% CI) for survival to discharge of the ED group was 2.34 (1.02-5.40) in patients with CAG and 0.28 (0.04-1.84) in patients without CAG (p for interaction was 0.04).
CONCLUSION: In adult OHCA patients who underwent ECPR and CAG, ECPR in the ED shortened time to ECMO pump-on time and increased survival to discharge compared to ECPR in the Cath lab.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Studies on long-term outcomes after refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.
Methods
This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)).
Results
A total of 101 patients with refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94–123] minutes. The hospital discharge rate was 27\%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years ± 1.6 (range 2.8–6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1–2 was found in 93\% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean MoCA score of 26.4 ± 3.1. Functional capacity examined by CPX showed acceptable VO2 max values (23.9 ± 6.3 mL/kg/min). Mean SF-36 scores revealed an overall high level of quality of life in long-term survivors.
Conclusions
Long-term survival with a good neurological outcome with functional recovery was high in patients with refractory OHCA treated with MCS. These patients may expect a reasonable quality of life after discharge despite prolonged resuscitation.},

	abstract = {IntroductionField identification of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and advanced hospital notification decreases first-medical-contact-to-balloon (FMC2B) time. A recent study in this system found that electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission following a STEMI alert was frequently unsuccessful.HypothesisInstituting weekly test ECG transmissions from paramedic units to the hospital would increase successful transmission of ECGs and decrease FMC2B and door-to-balloon (D2B) times.
METHODS: This was a natural experiment of consecutive patients with field-identified STEMI transported to a single percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable hospital in a regional STEMI system before and after implementation of scheduled test ECG transmissions. In November 2014, paramedic units began weekly test transmissions. The mobile intensive care nurse (MICN) confirmed the transmission, or if not received, contacted the paramedic unit and the department's nurse educator to identify and resolve the problem. Per system-wide protocol, paramedics transmit all ECGs with interpretation of STEMI. Receiving hospitals submit patient data to a single registry as part of ongoing system quality improvement. The frequency of successful ECG transmission and time to intervention (FMC2B and D2B times) in the 18 months following implementation was compared to the 10 months prior. Post-implementation, the time the ECG transmission was received was also collected to determine the transmission gap time (time from ECG acquisition to ECG transmission received) and the advanced notification time (time from ECG transmission received to patient arrival).
RESULTS: There were 388 patients with field ECG interpretations of STEMI, 131 pre-intervention and 257 post-intervention. The frequency of successful transmission post-intervention was 73\% compared to 64\% prior; risk difference (RD)=9\%; 95\% CI, 1-18\%. In the post-intervention period, the median FMC2B time was 79 minutes (inter-quartile range [IQR]=68-102) versus 86 minutes (IQR=71-108) pre-intervention (P=.3) and the median D2B time was 59 minutes (IQR=44-74) versus 60 minutes (IQR=53-88) pre-intervention (P=.2). The median transmission gap was three minutes (IQR=1-8) and median advanced notification time was 16 minutes (IQR=10-25).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of weekly test ECG transmissions was associated with improvement in successful real-time transmissions from field to hospital, which provided a median advanced notification time of 16 minutes, but no decrease in FMC2B or D2B times.

	abstract = {Current guidelines recommend early reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 90min of first medical encounter. Telecardiology entails the use of advanced communication technologies to transmit the prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to offsite cardiologists for early triage to the cath lab; which has been shown to dramatically reduce door-to-balloon time and total mortality. However, hospitals often find adopting ECG transmission technologies very challenging. The current review identifies seven major technical challenges of prehospital ECG transmission, including: paramedics inconvenience and transport delay; signal noise and interpretation errors; equipment malfunction and transmission failure; reliability of mobile phone networks; lack of compliance with the standards of digital ECG formats; poor integration with electronic medical records; and costly hardware and software pre-requisite installation. Current and potential solutions to address each of these technical challenges are discussed in details and include: automated ECG transmission protocols; annotatable waveform-based ECGs; optimal routing solutions; and the use of cloud computing systems rather than vendor-specific processing stations. Nevertheless, strategies to monitor transmission effectiveness and patient outcomes are essential to sustain initial gains of implementing ECG transmission technologies.},

	abstract = {Prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission to hospitals was shown to reduce time to treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, new technologies allow transmission directly to a mobile unit so an attending physician can respond irrespective of presence within or outside the hospital. The primary study purpose was to determine whether delays could be decreased in an urban area by transmitting a prehospital 12-lead ECG directly to the attending cardiologist’s mobile telephone for rapid triage and transport to a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center, bypassing local hospitals and emergency departments. A secondary purpose was to describe whether transport would be safe despite longer transport times. During a 2-year period, patients with acute nontraumatic chest pain had their prehospital ECG transmitted directly to a cardiologist’s mobile telephone. Time to treatment was compared with historic controls. After ECG evaluation, 168 patients (30\%) were referred directly for PCI, and 146 of these (87\%) underwent emergent catheterization. In referred patients, median time from 911 call to PCI was significantly shorter than in the control group (74 vs 127 minutes; p {\textless}0.001). Accordingly, door-to-PCI time was 63 minutes shorter for referred patients versus controls (34 vs 97 minutes; p {\textless}0.001). During transport, 7 patients (4\%) experienced ventricular fibrillation; 3 patients (2\%), ventricular tachycardia; and 1 patient (0.5\%), pulseless electrical activity, including 2 deaths (1\%) caused by treatment-resistant arrhythmia. In conclusion, transmission of a prehospital 12-lead ECG directly to the attending cardiologist’s mobile telephone decreased door-to-PCI time by {\textgreater}1 hour when patients were transported directly to PCI centers, bypassing local hospitals. Ambulance transport seems safe despite longer transport times.},

	abstract = {Background
Dynamic changes in electrocardiographic findings between initial and follow-up electrocardiograms (ECGs) have rarely been studied for disease severity and differential diagnosis in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. We aimed to determine whether the changes in staple variables on ECG can assist in distinguishing between neuropsychiatric or gastrointestinal disorders (mild non-ischemic disorders), heart failure, and NSTE-ACS (non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome).
Methods
This retrospective study enrolled 1279 patients who presented with ischemic symptoms; were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS, acute heart failure, and mild disorders; and underwent echocardiography and coronary angiography. After performing propensity matching of the ECG follow-up interval, 184 patients with symptom onset within 48 h were included and analyzed.
Results
As a discriminator for NSTE-ACS, the maximum change in the T/QRS ratio in two contiguous leads was superior to the maximum change in ST segment depression, T wave inversion, and ST/T ratio. ECGs of patients with NSTE-ACS and heart failure showed a tendency to increase and decrease the T/QRS ratio change, respectively. Compared with regional wall motion abnormality, the change in troponin I/h and the maximum change in ST segment depression and T-wave inversion, the most deviated T/QRS ratio change from 1 ({\textgreater}1.5 or {\textless} 0.5) in two contiguous leads was the most significant discriminator for disease severity and differential diagnosis (standardized β = 0.545, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion
The maximum changes in the T/QRS ratio in two contiguous leads can assist in distinguishing disease severity and acute mimicking disease such as acute heart failure in patients with suspected ACS.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study was to develop and validate a score to accurately predict the probability of death for adult extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).
Background
ECPR is being increasingly used to treat refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), but survival varies from 20\% to 40\%.
Methods
Adult patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for IHCA (ECPR) were identified from the American Heart Association GWTG-R (Get With the Guidelines–Resuscitation) registry. A multivariate survival prediction model and score were developed to predict hospital death. Findings were externally validated in a separate cohort of patients from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry who underwent ECPR for IHCA.
Results
A total of 1,075 patients treated with ECPR were included. Twenty-eight percent survived to discharge in both the derivation and validation cohorts. A total of 6 variables were associated with in-hospital death: age, time of day, initial rhythm, history of renal insufficiency, patient type (cardiac vs noncardiac and medical vs surgical), and duration of the cardiac arrest event, which were combined into the RESCUE-IHCA (Resuscitation Using ECPR During IHCA) score. The model had good discrimination (area under the curve: 0.719; 95\% CI: 0.680-0.757) and acceptable calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit P = 0.079). Discrimination was fair in the external validation cohort (area under the curve: 0.676; 95\% CI: 0.606-0.746) with good calibration (P = 0.66), demonstrating the model’s ability to predict in-hospital death across a wide range of probabilities.
Conclusions
The RESCUE-IHCA score can be used by clinicians in real time to predict in-hospital death among patients with IHCA who are treated with ECPR.},

	abstract = {Background  The current guidelines of the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend that when right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) is present patients are not administered nitrates, due to the risk that decreasing preload in the setting of already compromised right ventricular ejection fraction may reduce cardiac output and precipitate hypotension. The cohort study (n=40) underlying this recommendation was recently challenged by new studies suitable for meta-­analysis (cumulatively, n=1050), suggesting that this topic merits systematic review.
Methods  The protocol was registered on PROSPERO and published in Evidence Synthesis. Six databases were systematically searched in May 2022: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE Complete, Cochrane CENTRAL Register, CINAHL and Google Scholar. Two investigators independently assessed for quality and bias and extracted data using Joanna Briggs Institute tools and methods. Risk ratios and 95\% CIs were calculated, and meta-­analysis performed using the random effects inverse variance method.
Results  Five studies (n=1113) were suitable. Outcomes included haemodynamics, GCS, syncope, arrest and death. Arrest and death did not occur in the RVMI group. Meta-­analysis was possible for sublingual nitroglycerin 400 μg (2 studies, n=1050) and found no statistically significant difference in relative risk to combined inferior and RVMI at 1.31 (95\% CI 0.81 to 2.12, p=0.27), with an absolute effect of 3 additional adverse events per 100 treatments. Results remained robust under sensitivity analysis.
Conclusions  This review suggests that the AHA and ESC contraindications are not supported by evidence. Key limitations include all studies having concomitant inferior and RVMI, not evaluating beneficial effects and very low certainty of evidence. As adverse events are transient and easily managed, nitrates are a reasonable treatment modality to consider during RVMI on current evidence. PROSPERO registration number  CRD42020172839.},

	abstract = {The duration of low flow prior to initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) appears to influence survival. Strategies to reduce the low-flow interval for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have been focused on expediting patient transport to the hospital or initiating extracorporeal support in the prehospital setting. To date, a direct comparison of low-flow interval between these strategies has not been made. To attempt this comparison, a model was created to predict low-flow intervals for each strategy at different locations across the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The data, specific to Albuquerque, suggest that a prehospital cannulation strategy consistently outperforms an expedited transport strategy, with an estimated difference in low-flow interval of 34.3 to 37.2 minutes, depending on location. There is no location within the city in which an expedited transport strategy results in a shorter low-flow interval than prehospital cannulation. It would be rare to successfully initiate eCPR by either strategy in fewer than 30 minutes from the time of patient collapse. Using a prehospital cannulation strategy, the entire coverage area could be eligible for eCPR within 60 minutes of patient collapse. The use of predictive modeling can be a low-cost solution to assist with strategic deployment of prehospital resources and may have potential for real-time decision support for prehospital clinicians.},

	abstract = {AIM: To perform a systematic review of the literature on intravenous (IV) vs. intraosseous (IO) administration of drugs during cardiac arrest in order to inform an update of international guidelines.
METHODS: The review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO. Medline, Embase and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews were searched on December 17, 2019 for studies comparing IV to IO administration of drugs. The population included neonatal, paediatric, and adult patients with cardiac arrest. Two investigators reviewed each search for study relevance, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of individual studies. Meta-analyses were performed for studies without a critical risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.
RESULTS: We included six observational studies comparing IV to IO administration of drugs and two randomized trials assessing the effect of specific drugs in subgroups related to IV vs. IO administration. All studies included adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. No studies were identified in neonatal or paediatric patients. The risk of bias for the observational studies was overall assessed as critical or serious, with confounding and selection bias being the primary sources of bias. The meta-analyses excluding studies with a critical risk of bias favoured IV access for all outcomes. Using GRADE, the certainty of evidence was judged at very low. Subgroup analyses of the two randomized trials demonstrated no statistically significant interactions between the route of access and study drugs on outcomes. However, these trials were underpowered to assess such interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a limited number of studies comparing IV vs. IO administration of drugs during cardiac arrest. Pooled results from four observational studies favoured IV access with very low certainty of evidence. From the subgroup analyses of two randomized clinical trials, there was no statistically significant interaction between the route of access and study drug on outcomes.},

METHODS: Patients were recruited from five National Health Service Ambulance Services in England and Wales from December 2014 through October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg adrenaline or matching placebo. Intravascular access was established as soon as possible, and IO access was considered if IV access was not possible after two attempts.
RESULTS: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 3631 received adrenaline and 3686 received placebo. Amongst these, 1116 (30.1\%) and 1121 (30.4\%) received the study drug via the IO route. The odds ratios were similar in the IV and IO groups for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital handover [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.07 (95\% CI 3.42-4.85) and (aOR 3.98 (95\% CI 2.86-5.53), P value for interaction 0.90]; survival to 30 days [aOR 1.67 (1.18-2.35) versus 0.9 (0.4-2.05), P = 0.18]; and favourable neurological outcome [aOR 1.39 (0.93-2.06) versus 0.62 (0.23-1.67), P = 0.14].
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in treatment effect (adrenaline versus placebo) on ROSC at hospital handover between drugs administered by the intraosseous route or by the intravenous route. We could not detect any difference in the treatment effect between the IV and IO routes on the longer term outcomes of 30-day survival or favourable neurological outcome at discharge (ISRCTN73485024).},

The objective of the study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of intraosseous vs intravenous administration of morphine sulfate in adults. Methods The study followed a prospective, randomized, crossover design. Each subject was equipped with an indwelling intraosseous access device and an intravenous line. Subjects were randomized to receive a 5-mg bolus of morphine sulfate infused intraosseously or intravenously, followed by the alternate administration route 24 hours later. Serial venous blood samples (5 mL) were taken at baseline and at 13 time points over 8 hours postinfusion. Blood samples were analyzed for morphine concentration by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the data, including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), among others. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Results No statistically significant differences were observed between intraosseous and intravenous administration of morphine sulfate for nearly all of the pharmacokinetic parameters including Cmax (235 ± 107 vs 289 ± 197 ng/mL, mean ± SD, IO vs IV, respectively), Tmax (1.3 ± 0.5 vs 1.4 ± 0.5 minutes), and AUC(0-∞) (4372 ± 1785 vs 4410 ± 1930 ng min−1 mL−1). There was, however, a statistically significant difference in the volume of distribution in the central compartment, Vd (P = .0247), which in the opinion of the investigators was thought to be due to a minor deposition effect near the intraosseous port or in the bone marrow. Conclusion The results support the bioequivalence of intraosseous and intravenous administration of morphine sulfate in adults.},

eCPR, the modality of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) applied in the setting of cardiac arrest, has emerged as a novel therapy which may improve outcomes in select patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). To date, implementation has been mainly limited to single academic centres. Our objective is to describe the feasibility and challenges with implementation of a regional protocol for eCPR.
Methods
The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency implemented a regional eCPR protocol in July 2020, which included coordination across multiple EMS provider agencies and hospitals to route patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation (rVF) OHCA to eCPR-capable centres (ECCs). Data were entered on consecutive patients with rVF with suspected cardiac aetiology into a centralized database including time intervals, field and in-hospital care, survival and neurologic outcome.

From July 27, 2020 through July 31, 2022, 35 patients (median age 57 years, 6 (17\%) female) were routed to ECCs, of whom 11 (31\%) received eCPR and 3 (27\%) treated with eCPR survived, all of whom had a full neurologic recovery. Challenges encountered during implementation included cost to EMS provider agencies for training, implementation, and purchase of automatic chest compression devices, maintenance of system awareness, hospital administrative support for staffing and equipment for the ECMO program, and interdepartmental coordination at ECCs.
Conclusion
We describe the successful implementation of a regional eCPR program with ongoing patient enrolment and data collection. These preliminary findings can serve as a model for other EMS systems who seek to implement regional eCPR programs.},

These patients have a poor prognosis and would benefit from immediate reperfusion therapy, but, currently, there are no accurate tools to identify them during initial triage. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first observational cohort study to develop machine learning models for the ECG diagnosis of OMI. Using 7,313 consecutive patients from multiple clinical sites, we derived and externally validated an intelligent model that outperformed practicing clinicians and other widely used commercial interpretation systems, substantially boosting both precision and sensitivity. Our derived OMI risk score provided enhanced rule-in and rule-out accuracy relevant to routine care, and, when combined with the clinical judgment of trained emergency personnel, it helped correctly reclassify one in three patients with chest pain. ECG features driving our models were validated by clinical experts, providing plausible mechanistic links to myocardial injury.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveThe number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who may benefit from prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is yet to be elucidated. Patient eligibility is determined both by case characteristics and physical proximity to an ECPR service. We applied accessibility principles to historical cardiac arrest data, to identify the number of patients who would have been eligible for prehospital ECPR in Sydney, Australia, and the potential survival benefit had prehospital ECPR been available.METHODSThe New South Wales cardiac arrest registry between January 2017 to June 2021 included 39,387 cardiac arrests. We retrospectively defined two groups: 1) possible ECPR eligible arrests that would have triggered activation of a team, and 2) ECPR eligible arrests, those arrests that met ECPR inclusion criteria and remained refractory. Transport accessibility modelling was used to ascertain the number of arrests that would have been served by a hypothetical prehospital service and the potential survival benefit.RESULTSThere were 699 arrests screened as possibly ECPR eligible in the Sydney metropolitan area, 488 of whom were subsequently confirmed as ECPR eligible refractory OHCA. Of these, 38\% (n =185) received intra-arrest transfer to hospital, with 37\% (n = 180) arriving within 60 minutes. Using spatial and transport modelling, a prehospital team located at an optimal location could establish 437 (90\%) patients onto ECMO within 60 minutes, with an estimated survival of 48\% (IQR 38-57). Based on existing survival curves, compared to conventional CPR, an optimally located prehospital ECPR service has the potential to save one additional life for every 3.0 patients.CONCLUSIONSA significant number of historical OHCA patients could have benefited from prehospital ECPR, with a potential survival benefit above conventional CPR.},

	abstract = {Objective
To implement an all-day online artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted detection of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) to facilitate patient triage for timely reperfusion therapy.

Methods
The proposed AI model combines a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to predict STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from mini-12-lead ECG devices equipped in ambulance vehicles in Central Taiwan. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the 14 AI-implemented fire stations performed the on-site 12-lead ECG examinations using the mini portable device. The 12-lead ECG signals were transmitted to the AI center of China Medical University Hospital to classify the recordings as “STEMI” or “Not STEMI”. In 11 non-AI fire stations, the ECG data were transmitted to a secure network and read by available on-line emergency physicians. The response time was defined as the time interval between the ECG transmission and ECG interpretation feedback.

Results
Between July 17, 2021, and March 26, 2022, the AI model classified 362 prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from 275 consecutive patients who had called the 119 dispatch centers of fire stations in Central Taiwan for symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. The AI's response time to the EMTs in ambulance vehicles was 37.2 ± 11.3 s, which was shorter than the online physicians' response time from 11 other fire stations with no AI implementation (113.2 ± 369.4 s, P {\textless} 0.001) after analyzing another set of 335 prehospital 12-lead ECGs. The evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1 score to assess the overall AI performance in the remote detection of STEMI were 0.992, 0.889, 0.994, 0.941, 0.997, and 0.914, respectively. During the study period, the AI model promptly identified 10 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) with a median contact-to-door time of 18.5 (IQR: 16–20.8) minutes.

Conclusion
Implementation of an all-day real-time AI-assisted remote detection of STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs in the field is feasible with a high diagnostic accuracy rate. This approach may help minimize preventable delays in contact-to-treatment times for STEMI patients who require PPCI.},

in-hospital mortality did not increase significantly with increasing delay
from MI symptom onset to first balloon inflation. However, for door-to-balloon

significantly increased by 41\% to 62\% for patients with door-to-balloon times
longer than 2 hours (for 121-150 minutes: odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95\% confidence

door-to-balloon times and that door-to-balloon time should be considered when

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effect of door-to-balloon time on mortality for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
BACKGROUND: Studies have found conflicting results regarding this relationship.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 29,222 STEMI patients treated with PCI within 6 h of presentation at 395 hospitals that participated in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI)-3 and -4 from 1999 to 2002. We used hierarchical models to evaluate the effect of door-to-balloon time on in-hospital mortality adjusted for patient characteristics in the entire cohort and in different subgroups of patients based on symptom onset-to-door time and baseline risk status.
RESULTS: Longer door-to-balloon time was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (mortality rate of 3.0\%, 4.2\%, 5.7\%, and 7.4\% for door-to-balloon times of {\textless} or =90 min, 91 to 120 min, 121 to 150 min, and {\textgreater}150 min, respectively; p for trend {\textless}0.01). Adjusted for patient characteristics, patients with door-to-balloon time {\textgreater}90 min had increased mortality (odds ratio 1.42; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 1.62) compared with those who had door-to-balloon time {\textless} or =90 min. In subgroup analyses, increasing mortality with increasing door-to-balloon time was seen regardless of symptom onset-to-door time ({\textless} or =1 h, {\textgreater}1 to 2 h, {\textgreater}2 h) and regardless of the presence or absence of high-risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Time to primary PCI is strongly associated with mortality risk and is important regardless of time from symptom onset to presentation and regardless of baseline risk of mortality. Efforts to shorten door-to-balloon time should apply to all patients.},

There is little evidence identifying the association between hospital ECLS case volumes and outcomes in different populations receiving ECLS or conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The goal of this investigation was to identify the association between ECLS case volumes and clinical outcomes of OHCA patients.Methods This cross-sectional observational study used the National OHCA Registry for adult OHCA cases in Seoul, Korea between January 2015 and December 2019. If the ECLS volume during the study period was {\textgreater}20, the institution was defined as a high-volume ECLS center. Others were defined as low-volume ECLS centers. Outcomes were good neurologic recovery (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) and survival to discharge. We performed multivariate logistic regression and interaction analyses to assess the association between case volume and clinical outcome.Results Of the 17,248 OHCA cases, 3,731 were transported to high-volume centers. Among the patients who underwent ECLS, those at high-volume centers had a higher neurologic recovery rate than those at low-volume centers (17.0\% vs. 12.0\%), and the adjusted OR for good neurologic recovery was 2.22 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.15–4.28) in high-volume centers compared to low-volume centers. For patients who received conventional CPR, high-volume centers also showed higher survival-to-discharge rates (adjusted OR of 1.16, 95\%CI: 1.01–1.34).Conclusions High-volume ECLS centers showed better neurological recovery in patients who underwent ECLS. High-volume centers also had better survival-to-discharge rates than low-volume centers for patients not receiving ECLS.},

Methods A nonrandomized, prospective, observational study comparing flow rates with distal and proximal tibia IO access in adults using the EZ-IO–powered drill device. The proximal tibia was the first site of insertion, and a second IO was inserted in the distal tibia if clinically indicated. Intravenous saline infusion was started for all patients, initially without, then with a pressure bag device applied. Results From September 19, 2008 to November 3, 2010, 22 patients were recruited, with 20 proximal tibial and 22 distal tibia insertions. Two patients had only distal tibia IO insertions. Five distal tibia and 3 proximal tibia insertions had no flow when initiating normal saline infusion without pressure. Upon comparing the mean flow rates without pressure bag, it is significantly faster in the proximal tibia, 4.96 mL/min, compared with distal tibia, 2.07 ml/min, difference of 2.89 ml/min (95\% CI 1.20-4.58). Flow rates with pressure bags also revealed a similar result. Flow rates in the proximal tibia were significantly faster, 7.70 ml/min to that of distal tibia, 3.80 ml/min, difference of 3.89 ml/min (95\% CI 1.68-6.10). In both proximal and distal tibia groups, the flow rates are also significantly faster with pressure bags compared with without. Conclusion Flow rates are significantly faster in the proximal tibia compared with the distal tibia. In addition, flow rates with pressure bags are significantly faster than without pressure bags in both groups.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective Studies on humeral placement of the EZ-IO (Vidacare, Shavano Park, TX, USA) have shown mixed results. We performed a study to determine the first-attempt success rate at humeral placement of the EZ-IO by paramedics among prehospital adult cardiac arrest patients. Methods A retrospective cohort analysis of data prospectively collected over a 9-month period. Data are a subset extracted from a prehospital cardiac arrest study. The cohort consisted of adult cardiac arrest patients in whom the EZ-IO placement was attempted in the humerus by paramedics. Choice of vascular access was at the discretion of the paramedic; options included tibial or humeral EZ-IO and intravenous. Primary outcome is the percentage of successful placements (stable, flow, without extravasation) on first attempt. Secondary outcomes are overall successful placement, complications, and reason for failure. Data were collected during a post–cardiac arrest interview. Results Humeral intraosseous (IO) access was attempted in 61\% (n = 247) of 405 cardiac arrests evaluated with mean age of 63 (±16) years, 58\% male. First-attempt successful placement was 91\%. Successful placement was 94\%, considering the second attempts. In the unsuccessful attempts, 2\% reported obesity as the cause, 1\% reported stable placement without flow, and 2\% reported undocumented causes for failure. There were also 2\% reports of successful placement with subsequent dislodgement. Conclusions The results of this study suggest a high degree of paramedic proficiency in establishment of IO access in the proximal humerus of the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Few complications suggest that proximal humeral IO access is a reliable method for vascular access in this patient population.},

Methods Every patient who required an intraosseous access with the EZ-IO from January 1st, 2009 to December 31st, 2011 was included. The main data collected were: age, sex, indication for intraosseous access, localisation of insertion, success rate, drugs and fluids administered, and complications. All published studies concerning the EZ-IO device were systematically searched and reviewed for comparison. Results Fifty-eight patients representing 60 EZ-IO procedures were included. Mean age was 47 years (range 0.5–91), and the success rate was 90\%. The main indications were cardiorespiratory arrest (74\%), major trauma (12\%), and shock (5\%). The anterior tibia was the main route. The main drugs administered were adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and amiodarone. No complications were reported. We identified 30 heterogeneous studies representing 1603 EZ-IO insertions. The patients' characteristics and success rate were similar to our study. Complications were reported in 13 cases (1.3\%). Conclusion The EZ-IO provides an effective way to achieve vascular access in the pre-hospital setting. Our results were similar to the cumulative results of all studies involving the use of the EZ-IO, and that can be used for comparison for further studies.},

Methods This retrospective analysis included adult patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin who had Emergency Medical Services (EMS) CPR, received adrenaline, and were enrolled in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Cardiac Epistry version 3 database between 2011 and 2015. We divided the study population into IV and IO groups based on the administration route. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between adrenaline delivery routes and prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and favorable neurological outcome. Results Of the 35,733 patients included, 27,758 (77.7\%) had adrenaline administered via IV access and 7975 (22.3\%) via IO access. With the IO group as a reference in the logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratios of the IV group for prehospital ROSC, survival and favorable neurological outcome were 1.367 (95\%CI, 1.276–1.464), 1.468 (95\%CI, 1.264–1.705) and 1.849 (95\%CI, 1.526–2.240), respectively. Similar results were found in the propensity score matched population and subgroup analysis. Conclusion Compared with the IO approach, the IV approach appears to be the optimal route for adrenaline administration in advanced life support for OHCA during prehospital resuscitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aims Although the intraosseous (IO) route is increasingly used for vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), little is known about its comparative effectiveness relative to intravenous (IV) access. We evaluated clinical outcomes following OHCA comparing drug administration via IO versus IV routes. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-treated adults with atraumatic OHCA in a large metropolitan EMS system between 9/1/2012–12/31/2014. Access was classified as IO or IV based on the route of first EMS drug administration. Study endpoints were survival to hospital discharge, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital admission. Results Among 2164 adults with OHCA, 1800 met eligibility criteria, 1525 of whom were treated via IV and 275 principally via tibial-IO routes. Compared to IV, IO-treated patients were younger, more often women, had unwitnessed OHCA, a non-cardiac aetiology, and presented with non-shockable rhythms. IO versus IV-treated patients were less likely to survive to hospital discharge (14.9\% vs 22.8\%, p=0.003), achieve ROSC (43.6\% vs 55.5\%, p Conclusion Though not independently associated with survival to discharge, principally tibial IO versus IV treatment was associated with a lower likelihood of ROSC and hospitalization. How routes of vascular access influence clinical outcomes after OHCA merits additional study.},

	abstract = {Study objective Intraosseous needle insertion during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is rapidly replacing peripheral intravenous routes in the out-of-hospital setting. However, there are few data directly comparing the effectiveness of intraosseous needle insertions with peripheral intravenous insertions during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in the frequency of first-attempt success between humeral intraosseous, tibial intraosseous, and peripheral intravenous insertions during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods This was a randomized trial of adult patients experiencing a nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in which resuscitation efforts were initiated. Patients were randomized to one of 3 routes of vascular access: tibial intraosseous, humeral intraosseous, or peripheral intravenous. Paramedics received intensive training and exposure to all 3 methods before study initiation. The primary outcome was first-attempt success, defined as secure needle position in the marrow cavity or a peripheral vein, with normal fluid flow. Needle dislodgement during resuscitation was coded as a failure to maintain vascular access. Results There were 182 patients enrolled, with 64 (35\%) assigned to tibial intraosseous, 51 (28\%) humeral intraosseous, and 67 (37\%) peripheral intravenous access. Demographic characteristics were similar among patients in the 3 study arms. There were 130 (71\%) patients who experienced initial vascular access success, with 17 (9\%) needles becoming dislodged, for an overall frequency of first-attempt success of 113 (62\%). Individuals randomized to tibial intraosseous access were more likely to experience a successful first attempt at vascular access (91\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 83\% to 98\%) compared with either humeral intraosseous access (51\%; 95\% CI 37\% to 65\%) or peripheral intravenous access (43\%; 95\% CI 31\% to 55\%) groups. Time to initial success was significantly shorter for individuals assigned to the tibial intraosseous access group (4.6 minutes; interquartile range 3.6 to 6.2 minutes) compared with those assigned to the humeral intraosseous access group (7.0 minutes; interquartile range 3.9 to 10.0 minutes), and neither time was significantly different from that of the peripheral intravenous access group (5.8 minutes; interquartile range 4.1 to 8.0 minutes). Conclusion Tibial intraosseous access was found to have the highest first-attempt success for vascular access and the most rapid time to vascular access during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with peripheral intravenous and humeral intraosseous access.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of IV access versus IO access in terms of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for patients suffering from cardiac arrest. Methods A retrospective chart review examining cardiac arrest data with a single advanced life support EMS agency over a 4-year period was performed. Cardiac arrest patients were identified from a quality assurance database. Exclusion criteria included trauma arrest, pediatrics, pregnancy, and obvious signs of death. Results A total of 795 patients remained after applying the exclusion criteria. A total of 183 (45.1\%) out of 406 cardiac arrest patients achieved ROSC who had an IV placed. A total of 389 cardiac arrest patients had an IO placed with ROSC in 100 (25.7\%). Conclusions Higher ROSC rates were achieved with IV access versus IO access. Limitations include the small sample size, a single EMS agency, and the retrospective nature of the study.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION This study is aimed to investigate the association of intraosseous (IO) versus intravenous (IV) route during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science from the database inception through April 2020. Our search strings included designed keywords for two concepts, i.e. vascular access and cardiac arrest. There were no limitations implemented in the search strategy. We selected studies comparing IO versus IV access in neurological or survival outcomes after OHCA. Favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was pre-specified as the primary outcome. We pooled the effect estimates in random-effects models and quantified the heterogeneity by the I2 statistics. Time to intervention, defined as time interval from call for emergency medical services to establishing vascular access or administering medications, was hypothesized to be a potential outcome moderator and examined in subgroup analysis with meta-regression. RESULTS Nine retrospective observational studies involving 111,746 adult OHCA patients were included. Most studies were rated as high quality according to Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The pooled results demonstrated no significant association between types of vascular access and the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.33; I2, 95\%). In subgroup analysis, time to intervention was noted to be positively associated with the pooled OR of achieving the primary outcome (OR: 3.95, 95\% CI, 1.42-11.02, p: 0.02). That is, when the studies not accounting for the variable of "time to intervention" in the statistical analysis were pooled together, the meta-analytic results between IO access and favourable outcomes would be biased toward inverse association. No obvious publication bias was detected by the funnel plot. CONCLUSIONS The meta-analysis revealed no significant association between types of vascular access and neurological outcomes at hospital discharge among OHCA patients. Time to intervention was identified to be an important outcome moderator in this meta-analysis of observation studies. These results call for the need for future clinical trials to investigate the unbiased effect of IO use on OHCA CPR.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater} Recent evidence showing the clinical effectiveness of drug therapy in cardiac arrest has led to renewed interest in the optimal route for drug administration in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Current resuscitation guidelines support use of the intravenous route for intra-arrest drug delivery, with the intraosseous route reserved for patients in whom intravenous access cannot be established. We sought to evaluate current evidence on drug route for administration of cardiac arrest drugs, with a specific focus on the intravenous and intraosseous route. We identified relevant animal, manikin, and human studies through targeted searches of MEDLINE in June 2022. Across pre-hospital systems, there is wide variation in use of the intraosseous route. Early administration of cardiac arrest drugs is associated with improved patient outcomes. Challenges in obtaining intravenous access mean that the intraosseous access may facilitate earlier drug administration. However, time from administration to the central circulation is unclear with pharmacokinetic data limited mainly to animal studies. Observational studies comparing the effect of intravenous and intraosseous drug administration on patient outcomes are challenging to interpret because of resuscitation time bias and other confounders. To date, no randomised controlled trial has directly compared the effect on patient outcomes of intraosseous compared with intravenous drug administration in cardiac arrest. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has described the urgent need for randomised controlled trials comparing the intravenous and intraosseous route in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Ongoing clinical trials will directly address this knowledge gap.},
